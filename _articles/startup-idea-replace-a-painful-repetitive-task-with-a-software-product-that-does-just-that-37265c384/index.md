Idea for startups: Take one painful, labourious, repetitive task on Photoshop/Indesign/Sketch/Final Cut Pro/any editing software for that matter, and make that into a product.

  

Like this nifty little [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) web app. I love it. Removing backgrounds can already be done in Photoshop for sure, but to do it well (especially removing background from _hair_), it does take some manual effort. And it's a task that happens pretty often enough to feel quite repetitive, boring and simply an unproductive use of time after a while. Software automation is great for tasks of such nature - manual, labourious, simple-enough, repetitive, boring. 

  

I remember reading somewhere that Invision was built to facilitate client feedback, to make screen prototypes more shareable so that it's easy for anyone (even non-designers) to comment. Imagine the loss of productivity from endless emailing of pdfs back and forth, versioning the different files each time - clientwebsite-final-final-final.pdf. Again, Invision replaces one repetitive, labourious and painful task of communication ping-pong into a product. Same with Google Docs.

  

This idea for startups sounds so simple, yet so difficult to practice because everyday routine and habit blinds us to opportunities like these. So this made me think: 

  

> **What boring, painful and simple work tasks that we do repetitively and manually on a regular basis, can be replaced by automation/software?**

  

Let's hear it! ?
