So I'd been whining publicly about my writing slump here. I still feel dry and unstimulated to write. I think at it's core, it's really boredom. I commented to @christopherdeuda [yesterday](https://200wordsaday.com/words/cheating-the-writing-slump-89385c657a18d65da) that it's a feeling, of general uninspired-ness. Sure sounds like a definition of boredom to me. 

  

Then @lucjah said something strange. She said, "i so hope the general uninspired-ness will not leave you too soon. So many new really unexpected beautiful things may rise from there!" I loved that! It was reframing a slump, from what was usually deemed as a bad thing, into a beautiful opportunity. I'm like, totally inspired now, by the slump. Hahaha.

  

That got me thinking. I remember reading somewhere that boredom is key to creativity. A quick Google search brought up this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/make-time-for-boredom/524514/) by the Atlantic:

  

> An early, much-cited study gave participants abundant time to complete problem-solving and word-association exercises. Once all the obvious answers were exhausted, participants gave more and more inventive answers to fend off boredom.

  

Is this what is happening right now? That once all my obvious writing topics were exhausted, I'm now bored, and perhaps on the brink of that stage where I can start writing more and more inventive answers to fend off boredom? 

  

**_Wow._** 

  

I feel like I'm having a totally different relationship with my slump now, compared to just 2 days ago. 

  

Slump, don't go. Stay around, and see what fun we can have.
