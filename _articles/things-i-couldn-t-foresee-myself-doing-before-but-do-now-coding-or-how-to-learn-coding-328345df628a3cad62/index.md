Continuing from the [theme](https://200wordsaday.com/words/things-i-couldn-t-foresee-myself-doing-before-but-do-now-food-327355df394d46f27f) of "Things I couldn't foresee myself doing before, but do so now", learning how to do programming was the next thing. Or this could be titled: How to learn coding. Or my journey of [decoding coding](https://200wordsaday.com/@jasonleow/decoding-coding-135c32f17d2fdcb).

  

**"I wish I can code..."**

For the longest time, I was one of those who said "I wish I can code" but never really meant it. Why? Because my actions reflected my priorities, and seldom did coding end up being acted upon. Even when I did, it had a start-stop manner to it – I'll do a few tutorials, then quick. I'll pick up again, then quit after a few weeks. After a few cycles of earnest false starts of this, I was beginning to feel that coding is just not my thing. Maybe I'm just not hard-wired that way, I justified to myself. 

  

**Let's give this a shot, again**

But somehow, I [tried again](https://200wordsaday.com/words/decoding-coding-a-beginner-s-journey-into-learning-how-to-code-15625c2c7454d987a) in Jan this year, and tried to push through on learning. It helped that the Government gave everyone $500 to take whatever course they wanted, as part of a national upgrading initiative. OK the money barrier is settled. So I signed up for a few beginner courses on Udemy and made a few projects from it. Got some fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, mySQL. Those initial lessons were really just following a video tutorial line by line, and not really understanding what I was doing. A bit of monkey see monkey do. But it grew on me, slowly. It's like learning a new (spoken) language. Bit by bit, I connect doing this thing with getting this other thing. Cause and effect. I learned how to ask [better questions](https://200wordsaday.com/words/coding-is-knowing-how-to-ask-questions-well-67825c52bbddc6d56). By the end of the course, it boosted my confidence to try harder in other things. I had crossed a threshold. The threshold, [that moment when coding no longer felt scary](https://200wordsaday.com/words/that-moment-when-coding-no-longer-feels-scary-41135c3c58bb94b00). (I realised it was actually just higher pain tolerance of hitting the proverbial head against a wall when it comes to debugging)

  

**In love with Ruby**

Then next came my next milestone and challenge. I wanted to make a basic web app on [Ruby on Rails](https://200wordsaday.com/words/why-ruby-on-rails-266025d725d1193c53). This time I logged the steps in my journey and a pattern emerges:

  

1.  Get over initial learning slump. Muster inspiration and courage by reading articles about other prolific makers and developers whom I look up to, listening to podcasts etc.
2.  You fear what you don't know. Read up articles about Rails, how-tos, to-dos for noobs.
3.  Build early foundation (barely). Take a Rails course online, build basic app/blog, "see how easy it is?!" I tried a few of [MacKenzie Child's 12 in 12 Rails course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-) on Youtube.
4.  Try tutorials for building specific features of the app I want to build. On top of the basic blog app I built, I took bits of MacKenzie's other tutorials and pieced them together to get the other features and functionality in, e.g. user accounts, authentication. 
5.  Keep going. Build, google, build. Learned more tools, like command line, Git, Github and serverless tools like Heroku. Ask for help from friends. Thanks @craigpetterson for your help! 
6.  F\*\*k it, just launch! And [Your Life In Months](http://yourlifeinmonths.com/) was born.
7.  Iterate based on feedback. It's now at a place where I like as a Version 1.0. More to come in the next versions!

  

**JAMming with nocode** 

After Rails, I took a hiatus because I really pushed it hard and got a bit of coding fatigue. At this time [JAMstack appeared on my horizon](https://200wordsaday.com/words/jamming-up-on-jamstack-301475dbad96f2a8ff), and I hopped onto it and had loads of fun making JAMstack sites! What followed was another whirlwind journey of learning (some) GatsbyJS, React, Markdown, and playing around with all the headless CMS in the market. Ended up with a productized service where I can make more JAMstack sites for other people - [Sweet Jam Sites](http://sweetjamsites.com/). In the same month I also indulged in nocode too and made [Keto List Singapore](https://ketolistsingapore.com/).

  

**What's next?**

This is usually where grandiose statements about what I will and want to achieve next come in. But something I learned in October about sparking joy in my work made me want to approach my goals in another way. **Just follow my curiosity and energy.** Take whatever comes, drop whatever bores, and ride on whatever pulls me forward. 

  

I'm not sure what will turn up on my [decoding coding journey](https://200wordsaday.com/@jasonleow/decoding-coding-135c32f17d2fdcb) next year, but I now know, at least, that I don't need to know and it's better for it.
