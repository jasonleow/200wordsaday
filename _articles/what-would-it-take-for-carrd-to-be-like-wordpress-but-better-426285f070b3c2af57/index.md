I was just thinking, with the growing popularity of [Carrd](https://carrd.co) right now especially among the nocode community, could it become the next Wordpress, but better?

  

I mean, I don't want Carrd to be exactly like Wordpress – not the security issues, bloated software, slow page loads, not-fit-for-purpose web builder. But there's many things which Carrd lacks right now which perhaps can be plugged by a third-party ecosystem akin to Wordpress massive industry of themes, plugins, widgets, especially for blogging, ecommerce, etc. 

  

If we were to use Carrd as a springboard for making all kinds of websites (just because Carrd's web builder is just so easy and intuitive to use), what kind of third-party software can we bring to it? What can the Wordpress ecosystem teach us about that?

  

**Theme marketplace**

Many folks are already doing this. But there's a market for it for sure, for well-designed Carrd templates for all manner of industries. Just have a look at Themeforest's categories for themes: blog, magazine, buddypress, corporate, creative, real estate, retail, technology, education. Imagine the ease of setting up a website on Carrd but for these industries!

  

**Blogs**

Wordpress was made originally for blogs, hence it was not really fit for purpose when it became the CMS for other types of websites. Carrd, on the other hand, was the opposite. It wasn't made for blogging, has no blog feature on it. What if we made a blog SaaS that handled all the CMS for blogging, and you just needed to copy-paste a script or embed code to display it on Carrd? Something like [Drop In Blog](https://dropinblog.com/). And with blogs come the need for discussion and comment threads. Something like [Commento](https://commento.io/) would work! 

  

**Directory listings**

It's not easy to show tables and card listings on Carrd. One hack-around I saw was to embed an Airtable table, but you can't tweak the UI and design of the table. Sheet2site has an embed feature too which would work on Carrd. This is the simplest kind of database widget that can be done right now on Carrd, more for static display of data. The next step is to use Google Sheets or Airtable as an actual database, with dynamic interactions and uses. How would that look like?

  

**Ecommerce** 

There's no easy way to do ecommerce on Carrd now. Yes, you can show images of products, add some text description, and link to a payment button via Gumroad, Paypal or Stripe. What if there's something lightweight, in the vein of Woocommerce or Shopify on Wordpress? 

  

**Widgets and code snippets**

Advanced forms that does conditional logic and calculations, ad ware, calendars for appointment booking, rich media galleries, popup modals for marketing, text-to-speech plugins (like Blogcast), charts and data viz, chat bots. 

  

_What other kinds of third-party software would be useful for Carrd? Any ideas?_
