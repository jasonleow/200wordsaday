Facebook reminded me today of something I posted years ago: 

  

> “I hope there are days when your coffee tastes like magic, your playlist makes you dance, strangers make you smile, and the night sky touches your soul. I hope you fall in love with being alive again.”

  

It's been a tough month, and I really needed that reminder. 

  

To keep my chin up. To stay optimistic and hopeful. To remember to look up to the blue skies every once in a while, or mesmerize over a beautiful pink sunset. To simply take joy in being alive, being safe, being healthy, and doing what I love.

  

It's been a tough month, because doing things outside of one's comfort zone is never easy, yet so necessary if I wish to grow and get better. I find myself grinding teeth and frowning brows often, and it's the furtherest thing from being able to spark joy in work. But perhaps I can learn that too. To slowly come to terms to it and start to enjoy what I don't enjoy. Perhaps this is "the pain that encloses my understanding", as Kahlil Gibran had so wisely said.

  

We'll see. Till then, I think Alan Watts can round off this timely reminder better than I can ever do myself:

  

> “The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.”
