Just a tiny reframing, yet all the difference. It's the end of the year, and a new year and decade coming. I'd been think back and planning ahead, and chanced on this slightly different way of framing goals and resolutions:

  

**Instead of "I will \_\_\_\_\_\_", use "I want to see if I can \_\_\_\_\_\_." Complete the sentence.** 

  

Somehow, it makes all the difference. Because instead of a bold proclamation in a strong, "done deal" affirmative tone of "I will", you phrase it in a way that sounds like an optimistic invitation to a challenge to yourself, via saying "I want to see if I can".

  

Maybe it's just me. I like learning, self-growth and taking steps towards actualisation of one's full potential. So anything that carries that tone of optimism and light, feels more right for me.

  

Just as an experiment, I tried rephrasing my various 2019 goals using "I want to see if I can" prefix. It works!

  

*   **I want to see if I can** learn my way to $1mil revenue by 1 Jan 2021. In return, I will learn diligently and work on my indie products, adhere to a habit system, and earn at least $83k per month (or $83/month from 100 true fans for 12 months).
*   **I want to see if I can** inject play and joy into my work.
*   **I want to see if I can** follow my energy and curiosity without planning any specific deadlines/goals.
*   **I want to see if I can** code my way to a lifestyle-profitable SaaS product.
*   **I want to see if I can** quit sugar, ice cream and fried snacks, and eliminate these unwholesome food cravings.
*   **I want to see if I can** get back to peak vitality and wellbeing, with a lean and fit body and zero health ailments.
*   **I want to see if I can**, just to see if I can!
