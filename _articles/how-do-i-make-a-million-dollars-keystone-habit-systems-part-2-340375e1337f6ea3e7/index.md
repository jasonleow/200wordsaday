I first asked my [#milliondollarquestion](https://200wordsaday.com/categories/milliondollarquestion) back in [Jun 2019](https://200wordsaday.com/words/how-do-i-make-a-million-dollars-1-196895cfbd4776e4ff). Since then, I had explored this audacious dream over more than 20 posts, with the last one in Nov 2019. In particular, regarding my keystone habits, I asked:

  

_**What keystone habits and habit systems do I need in order to get to $1mil?**_

  

I went on to decide that these were the 5 keystone habits I needed to create that background conditions to strive towards $1mil:

  

1.  Sleep
2.  Meditation
3.  Health & fitness
4.  Downtime for deloading, reviews and reflection
5.  Deliberate practice of deep work

  

Back then, it's hard to see how any of those habits contribute tangibly to a financial target of $1mil. I mentioned then that I'll report back if I discover I need specific keystone habits that's financial or revenue-related.

  

NOW is the time to report back (to myself, at least). I definitely need financial-related keystone habits. It's not enough to just have great productivity habits and an audacious goal. 

  

Since June last year, I've dialled down on my keystone habits, and I'm happy with my progress in all those habits I set out to form. I feel healthier than ever, lost 10kg, get enough sleep and rest, have time for reflection and no issues with deep work. But seems like that's not enough, because 6 months on, I'm nowhere near earning a sustainable revenue stream. I'm unhappy with my progress. I spent a lot of time learning new stuff, trying new tech, making a bunch of different products, but nothing stuck when it comes to revenue.

  

I got to do something better, something drastically different, to break that zero barrier. Everything is figureoutable. I just need to get real and more specific now, with that million dollar question. I really need a keystone habit that related to pushing for financial progress.

  

_**What specific financial keystone habit do I need in order to get to $1mil?**_

  

The theme for Juicy January will go some way to help with that, since I'm trying to learn more about marketing and monetization. But Juicy Jan will likely only help me pick up a bunch of growth hacks and selling techniques, not necessary a keystone habit to sustain financial progress. I had tried visualisation of success during meditation, using the 6 phase meditation technique by Mindvalley. It helps but seems insufficient.

  

What I really need is something:

*   that would have a strong enough spillover effect that triggers widespread change in other smaller habits (definition of a keystone habit). 
*   I can do everyday, no matter how minute, because I realize I don't really think about making money that much during my work day routine.
*   directly actionable and clearly moves the money needle.

  

I have no ideas yet. Have to muse more about it. Got to figure this out. _Fast._  

  

_Any good ideas what this specific financial keystone habit could be?_
