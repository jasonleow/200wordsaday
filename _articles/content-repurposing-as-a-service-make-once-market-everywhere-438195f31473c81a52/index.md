I just saw this tweeted out by @tylertringas - content repurposing-as-a-service, where a service repurposes your video interviews into "podcasts, blog post, social assets, newsletter snippets, etc". 

  

I recalled @Vinrob posted about a possible productized service where you write an article once (e.g. "how to start a productized service"), then you (or your VA) can post it in:

*   Quora answer to the question "How do I start a productized service?"
*   Youtube tutorial - 5 steps to starting a productized service, then slice it down to a video snippet for Facebook, LinkedIn and/or Instagram, IG Stories, Tik Tok
*   Tweet "How to start a productized service in 5 steps: A thread"
*   Graphic image snippet - Facebook group, Facebook page, other relevant Facebook groups, Twitter account snippet

  

Just produce content once, and spread it everywhere else on the internet in its appropriate formats. I love this idea! Marketing _**at scale**_. It reminds me of one of the reasons why I love making digital products—be it media, curated information, or code—is how you make once and sell multiple times. But in this case, make once and _market_ everywhere. 

  

Imagine there's a software-_**with**_\-a-service kind of business, where you send them your video file of an interview, and out pops all manner of content for every social media platform of your liking – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Tik Tok, Youtube, Twitch, Pinterest, Quora, Whatsapp/Telegram chat groups, podcasts, blog posts, cross posts on Medium, Dev.to, Indie Hackers, communities, forums, Discord, email newsletters, Substack. Imagine! Stacking the powers of automated design with some human curation/design by virtual assistants, you amplify your content reach by hundredfold or more.

  

Someone needs to go create this business asap...
