[@twizzle](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-why-i-started-teamstreak-225915d2c22cd670f7) shared this quote by Neil Gaiman, that made me went "a-ha!" and \*face-palm all at the same time:   

  

> Writers groups can be good and they can be bad. Depends on the people in them, and what they're in them for.  
> On the whole, anything that gets you writing and keeps you writing is a good thing. Anything that stops you writing is a bad thing. If you find your writers group stopping you from writing, then drop it.

  

Why "a-ha!" then \*face-palm? Because that principle so ludicrously simple to understand and even simpler to execute and stick to, yet I had never once thought about it! 

  

**Anything that makes me start and sustain writing is a good thing.** Anything, like a new writing habit, hack or technique, or even when suggesting new 200wad features.

  

As usual, my overthinking tendencies trip me up. Whenever I think about the state of my writing, my habits, techniques I'm using and experimenting with, I overthink about what the pros and cons are, and whether I should try it or continue in it. And I had been thinking about these things quite a bit recently, ever since hitting 200 on my streak, because I wanted to [new challenges](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-m-thinking-about-breaking-my-streak-intentionally-210745d1216fdc956d) and new growth. That also includes my (over-)thinking about my writing streak here, should I continue, or should I break it... 

  

So...parsimony as a heuristic. Einstein was often quoted saying, "Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler." 

  

So should my writing, and thinking about my writing.
