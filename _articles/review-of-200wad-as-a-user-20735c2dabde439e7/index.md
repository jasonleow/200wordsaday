I'd been using 200wad for 1 month now and had never written so much within such a short period. Here's my quick pros vs cons review of 200wad, **as a user**:

### Pros

? Clean, minimalist, distraction-free interface. Don't have to muck about with pictures keeps the focus on writing

? Streaks were super helpful in nudging me to keep at it.

? 200 words per day is a surprisingly low barrier. I often start thinking I won't make it to 200 words but before I know it, it's past 300 words already. It's like the motivation hack where you do 1 rep in your workout.

? [@basilesamel](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/basilesamel) is super committed to improving the platform! Requested features often get added within the same day!  

? Best part is getting inspiration for writing from others in the community! We borrow ideas, formats, and questions that lead us to writing our own piece. The community is probably the most exciting and promising part of the product.  

  

### Cons

? It's still an early stage product, so features are quite basic and bare bones. It's not exactly a con, because it's exciting to journey with it and see what new features will get built!

? Sometimes pictures help, especially when I wrote something for a photo I took. The context makes sense to include a picture. This contradicts my earlier point yes, but I wonder if there's a middle way where we can include pictures in context, but not be distracted by having to hunt down a perfect image to add to the text when we don't need it.

? Sometimes quality is an issue. Because people just want to keep their streak, they write something that's quite 'meh'. If they write for themselves, then whatever rocks their boat. But as a reader in a rapidly growing community, I find it increasingly harder to find quality posts that I enjoy reading and following.   

  

Next, I'll do a review from the perspective of a UX designer.

  

? Day 32 of the #200wad challenge.
