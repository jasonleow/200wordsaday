Writelier is closing tomorrow. But there's some options now for those who still wish to write daily. Some members of Writelier had been busy making replacements, myself included. Check out these sites!Â

And mine is still work-in-progress! I'm making a different take on daily writing, focusing more on setting goals and writing towards them. Find me on Twitter @jasonleowsg to be notified. Launch will probably be after Christmas and before New Year.

A bunch of us are also on Telegram. Let me know and we can add you.
