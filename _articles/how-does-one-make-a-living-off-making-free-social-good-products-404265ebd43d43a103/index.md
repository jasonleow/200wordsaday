Weird question, I know. It's almost oxymoronic to put "free" and "making a living" together in one sentence.

  

But my experience making free, social good products in [Altruistic April](https://cowriters.app/words/altruistic-april-wrap-up-398305eaada0aa2154) had been hinting at something. I don't know what, but it felt really good to do this work. I enjoyed it. Deeply. I loved the social impact it potentially brought. I loved being part of the tech for good scene, knowing like-_hearted_ people, aligning on the same energy lines of giving back and making a difference. I loved the purity of the intent, and the purity of the reception, which seems to be (at least in part) due to the lack of money in the efforts. It's also really empowering to be able to see a problem in your neighbourhood, society, country, and then just make something to help in a very tangible and real way. Even more empowering is how I called all the shots - no funders, no customers, no power dynamics and money influences in how I should work. I can just make for the love of making, and not be beholden to anyone other than myself. But of course, with the caveat of making something that the target users will find use and actually use – but even having to design something for users, doesn't make me beholden to them in the way that a monetary transaction would. 

  

It's a weird musing, this post. Considering how I ranted that enough is enough after making 15 products and not making any real money from it. I guess it reflects the inner conflict I feel about my work. 

  

The idealistic self versus the pragmatic self. I really wish there's a path where both can work as one. A pathway where one can make a living off making free social good products. 

  

Is there?
