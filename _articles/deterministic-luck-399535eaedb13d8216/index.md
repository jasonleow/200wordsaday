Something I saw recently from the Twitter webs, regarding luck:

  

> _Do nothing, all you get is pure chance._

> _Undirected hustle, luck finds you._

> _Focused hustle, you find luck._

> _Unique hustle, somebody's fortune becomes yours._

  

I like how it's tiered, almost explaining the spectrum of success stories one hears about indie makers. Some get a lucky break out of nowhere. Others try something random, make an overnight MVP, and it takes off. Yet some, grind on an idea with lots of passion, and eventually it takes off. The rarest and best of them all, know how to stack their skill stack, leverage opportunities offered by their immediate environment, and know the right people.

  

It also feels like a journey. Of learning that luck can be deterministic, in a way. That  we can have control over the fates more than we realised. From the first stage of seeing luck as pure randomness to slowly moving into stages two and three where you begin to realise the little pivot points where you leverage luck, to finally making your own luck (and fortune!). 

  

As a consultant myself, we love to use frameworks in our work, but are often teased for that. But frameworks are like maps, for the mind, for work, for life, and in this case, for luck. Rare that you come across a framework that has more utility than bullshit. I think this might be one of them.

  

_Which stage are you at? How will you get to the next?_
