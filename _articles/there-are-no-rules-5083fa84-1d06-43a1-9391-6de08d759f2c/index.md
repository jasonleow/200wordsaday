Overheard on the interwebs today:

> There are no rules.Â 

Run the dishwasher twice if you don't like having to rise it beforehand. Take a shower lying down. Eat ice cream for breakfast. There are no rules.

These four words are so empowering. I mean, we hear it, but how often do we really grasp the real significance of it? Feel it in our bones? I definitely heard it before in various forms lots of times, but today I felt it on my bones. Seriously, all the 'shoulds' we tell ourselves......when should we ever have to do it just because we 'should'? There are no rules. These are self-imposed, and all it needed was a brief moment of self awareness and clarity to break these daily illusions.

I should be working on my projects today. I should be sleeping. I should be working out. I should eat better. Sure, these are important. But on days when you're feeling low in energy, when you just want to sleep in, when you're caught up in other things, or when you simply don't feel like it, you have every permission to **not** have to do it today, even if you 'should'. Maybe after some rest and respite, I can do them tomorrow, but at no time is 'should' ever binding. Realising that is such a relief.

There are no rules.
