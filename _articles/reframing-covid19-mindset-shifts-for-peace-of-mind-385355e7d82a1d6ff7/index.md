Words matter. Our choice of words matter. The words we use can shape our perspective of a situation more than we realise. I wonder: what if we chose different words—more uplifting, optimistic words—to use when describing our lived experiences under COVID19? How might we reframe things, so as to bring about mindset shifts that will tide us through these hard times? 

  

So how about these:

  

From **stuck at home** to **safe at home**.

From **staying home to protect oneself** to **staying away to protect others**.   

From **social distancing** to **physical/safe distancing** to **distant socializing**. 

From **selfish hoarding** to **collective sharing**.

From **economic fallout** to **ecological renewal**.

From **loneliness** to **solitude**.

From **lockdown** to **personal retreat**.

From **shutdown** to **downtime**.

From **panic buying** to **mindful consumption**.

From **"What if I get infected by the irresponsible behaviour of others?"** to **"What can I do to boost my own immunity?"**.

From **"I heard my uncle/friend/dad say..."** to **"What are the facts? Where is the data? How do I follow the science?"**.

  

I know some of the above aren't dichotomous. And it's okay to feel down and out. It's normal. It's a pandemic. It's hard. We should acknowledge that. Yet, to help us get through the days, perhaps changing these words might help, more than we know. Now as we tend to swing more towards the former, more negative, panicky types of words, it will probably be helpful to try reframing in a way that helps us swing some ways towards the other, more optimistic side.

  

Words do matter.
