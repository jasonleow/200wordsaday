Finally, after almost 3 months, the government announced Phase 2 of post "Circuit Breaker" lockdown to begin on 19 June, this Friday.

  

Dining in will be allowed, with social groups up to 5 people. Beaches, gyms, pools re-open. Travel to some countries which are covid clear will re-start. We can finally meet people outside of our households. Boyfriends can finally meet their girlfriends. Relatives can come together for a meal. But entertainment and drinks are still closed. Basically, the strictest of the lockdown measures are finally lifting. 

  

It feels unreal that this is happening in 4 days. After 3 months of crisis mode, is it truly over? With reports from other cities and countries—most recently Beijing itself—having a resurgence and second wave of infections since re-opening their economy, I can't help but suspect that this might be just a false hope. Maybe that's how it's going to be—a series of seasonal lockdowns and liftoffs—until a vaccine arrives. 

  

But did I mention that the lockdown measures will be lifted on my birthday? BEST F\*\*KING BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER. 

  

Time for a hair cut, dining out with the family, and coffee with friends like normal human beings. I. CAN'T. WAIT.
