Imagine a software development agency, but for nocode software. At $99/month, you get unlimited nocode small tasks, to build anything you or your organisation needs. A working prototype, a minimum viable product, or an internal dashboard or productivity tool. 

  

This idea was prompted by this tweet by [@tylertringas](https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1257427770143113218?s=21) who shared how they hired a part-time but in-house nocode developer who can ship software for business uses so fast, that's it's five times the productivity of a fullstack developer, but using only tools like Airtable, Zapier, Memberspace, Webflow, Makerpad and Integromat. The important caveat is knowing what's possible with what nocode tools, and what's not and scope things within what's possible. 

  

If an enterprise can find nocode tools sufficient for most business cases, then it goes to show how far nocode tools has come. Gone are the days just informational websites made on Wordpress, the original nocode. And the speed to market _is_ attractive for enterprises – imagine how much savings on manpower, time, and effort they can save from the speed. 

  

So I wonder when we'll start seeing a nocode productized service in the market. In productized services, especially for design, there's been a proven model of "unlimited tasks at a fixed monthly subscription". You see this for [Design Joy](https://www.designjoy.co/), offering unlimited design and revision at $999/month. Similarly for development, you see [WP Buffs](https://wpbuffs.com/plans/) providing 24/7 Wordpress website maintenance from $70/month onwards. Once you're able to scope down what kind of tasks you can do efficiently and cheaply, streamline your processes, you can offer unlimited nocode small tasks at a much more competitive rate than a run-of-the-mill developer. 

  

Makes me wonder...is there a market opportunity for one? Should I start one (even though I still want to continue to learn how to code!)? I'm already experimenting with specialist web design services using only nocode tools like Carrd and Sheet2site, so this feels like a natural extension. But there's a wide spectrum of nocode tools available out there in the market, and you can't be proficient in everything. So focusing on some of the main ones will be needed, like the WAMZstack (Webflow, Airtable, Memberspace and Zapier).

  

Hmmmm! ?

  

_If it only costs you $99/month to have access to unlimited nocode small tasks, what would you build?_
