I'd been musing about worldbuilding. It's something that I'd never tried writing and probably suck at, but yet that's how my inner child thinks and dreams. I wonder if writing 200 words of worldbuilding makes sense. How does one build worlds in 200 words or less? It's hard not to compare when I think of worldbuilding - Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, the Marvel Universe - and immediately I cower standing next to these giants. Most of all, it's easy to just stick to what I'm good at writing, and to avoid what makes me feel uncomfortable and apprehensive.   

  

But the inner child whispers. 

  

And what started as a whisper, is now getting increasingly louder. As my writing slump continues, this voice grows louder still. Unbound from the chains of learned rules and restraints, he now wants to stretch himself. 

  

Oh dear.

  

I don't know how, or where to start. But like any good parent, I shall indulge this inner child and do some research about it. And I found [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/):
