So the first 200wad competition is now over and I had the pleasure to be one of the judges for it. I shared my votes and comments with @basilesamel, but thought I could share this here anyway. Maybe it might be useful for the authors? I don't know, I can only assume that as someone who writes daily myself, hearing feedback is always interesting. 

  

So here’s my top 3 in order of preference:

  

? [@keni](https://200wordsaday.com/words/different-311605dcf27166c400) - love the storytelling, how it jumps right into a specific story, setting up the structure/flow for the rest of the post, yet still fulfilling the objective of being an icebreaker intro to herself. Good blend of storytelling and factuality. Authentic, uncomplicated, straightforward, and most importantly, she was open about her vulnerabilities, and that‘s always beautiful to read.

  

? [@keenencharles](https://200wordsaday.com/words/who-am-i-312195dd06ace2cbed) - philosophical, metaphysical, yet doesn’t come across as too lofty and yet still paints his key personal traits well. Very consistent and authentic to his own writing voice so far.

  

? [@Arcticloon](https://200wordsaday.com/words/who-am-i-311145dce4e189587f) - I love the writing voice addressing the reader, breaking the 4th wall kind of style. Very meta. Love how it ends - a simple, spot-on declaration of who she is.

  

It's awesome to see everyone writing to their best effort, and great to know the person behind the writing a little more through the "Ice Breaker" topic.
