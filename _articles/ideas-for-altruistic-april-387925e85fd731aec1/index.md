Since I decided to make things with [altruistic abandon for April](https://cowriters.app/words/altruistic-april-387515e84aa0d7e971)—anything COVID-19-related—I'd been observing needs and trends, and brainstorming ideas to plug those gaps. Some ideas so far:

  

**Listings sites galore**

I made a [listing site for businesses](https://outsprint.io/covid19), but with a civic blooming of mutual aid efforts, government initiatives and NGO programmes, perhaps there should be more listings now - for workers, industries, families, etc. All these listings need a listing, an umbrella mega-listing site to help people navigate to what they need.

  

**Concierge bot**

Form/chat bot with logic flow to help businesses see what government schemes they are eligible for. The Singapore Government had recently announced the [Resilience Budget](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/budgeting/covid-19-supplementary-resilience-budget-2020/), an add-on budget of $48billion, and the whole of government has responded to deal with a plethora of schemes, grants, rebates, funding. Not just for businesses but industries and workers too. So many that it's getting hard to navigate. Perhaps a logic flow in the format of an online form or messaging thread, that asks them a couple of questions to help them zoom in on the different funding they might have missed. Version 2.0 of this concierge form/bot could even be an extension of the mega-listing site from the first idea.

  

**Tools for nudging civic behaviour**

I'm not so sure what the solutions might look like, but here in Singapore, I think the government is trying really hard to get citizens to practice safe distancing and staying home. It's part complacency, part not understanding just how bad it is, part driven out of daily practicality. They released advisories, text messages, infographics to drive in the point. They put in a temporary bill to make it illegal for business owners to ignore safe distancing in their premises. But everyone need to be responsible and play their part, and short of enacting yet another law to enforce safe distancing behaviour, it's a hard uphill task of cultural/habit change on a massive scale. I'm thinking, what can we make to help people practice distancing better. Smartphone tech that beeps when others get too close? Comics and posters to drive home the point? A volunteer corps that walks around and tries to remind/convince people to stay apart?
