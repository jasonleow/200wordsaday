_Day 9 of the #200wad challenge._

  

Part 2 of a raw report card on my maker journey so far, in metrics. 2018 was a maker year for me. My very first year as an indie maker. In Feb, I made a commitment to launch a minimum viable product a month (#1mvp1month). See the list of products made in [Part 1](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-maker-year-in-products-made-5185c0f4273ac376).

### Cost$ vs Revenue$

I spent a total of ~US$700 so far on all my 8 MVPs, with managed hosting for Public Design Forum being the single biggest item ($200 upfront for a year). The rest had been small purchases – ~$60 per WordPress template, ~$20 per domain. It doesn’t include web hosting, which I already pay for anyway for my own blog (which is about $6/month for ALL my MVPs). That’s pretty lean as far as development of MVPs I feel!

Revenue so far is dismal, but at least I broke even on my costs. 3 sales on Outsprint Store about US$270. 7 coffees (US$5 each) pledged. 2 storyboarding gigs on UX Storyboard brought in US$530. That’s only a total revenue of around ~$830. So that's about $100 profit... but I haven’t even paid myself yet! ?

  

### Overall evaluation

**_Passed_**. Some products like Public Design Vault, UX Storyboard, Coffice City didn't do too badly at launch, but the others tanked. Sustaining traction was harder. Broke even, mostly. My only reward? Sh\*t loads of growth and learning.
