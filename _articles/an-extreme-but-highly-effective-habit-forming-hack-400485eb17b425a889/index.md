Everyone has OB markers. Things that you'll never do, lines you'll never cross, people or causes you'll rather die than to support, places you wouldn't even get near within a mile. Perhaps these OB markers are based on your moral values and perspective on ethics. Maybe it's from  personal experience or past trauma. Or it's even something you were simply brought up with and never questioned nor saw the need to question.

  

These OB markers are just the hack you need to form any habit you want. Yes, you heard that right. 

  

Any. Habit. You. Want.

  

How? So simple, all thanks to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/tkiramadden/status/1255516715502522370?s=21): 

  

*   Just write a cheque for a substantial amount of money. How much is considered substantial is subjective, so best to come up with your own. $100 might be substantial to me but spare change to someone else. 
*   Write this to an organisation or cause that sickens you to the core to support. It could be the gun association, or some political party you hate, or greedy capitalistic company that you swore to never shop at. Address that cheque for them.
*   Pass to a friend who is strong-willed and will hold you to your word. Tell him/her that if you don't develop that habit by the deadline you set out, he will then post that cheque to said organisation. And top that off, he will post it on social media and tag you, for added social pressure. 
*   And you're set. See that habit form like it's nothing.

  

Note though, that this hack is only as effective as you are serious when choosing the OB marker and the right organisation to send to. 

  

Very extreme, yes. But highly effective.
