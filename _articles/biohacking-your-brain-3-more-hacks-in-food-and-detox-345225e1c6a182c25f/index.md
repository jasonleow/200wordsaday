I'd been reading Dave Asprey's book Head Strong. It's all about biohacking the brain for peak performance, and after reading it, I'm hooked. I'm pretty new to the whole biohacking game, and if I do any of it, it's mostly related to my productivity habits. But he takes his hacks to a whole new level, in areas of life I never imagined as important to mental productivity before. 

  

**It's all in the mitochondria**

Productivity hacks can often feel quite fragmented. Do this for sleep, do that for work, eat this for diet. I like how he ties it all together, through mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses within each and every cell, in charge of producing energy. His main thesis is that mitochondria is the key to hacking the brain performance. He pushes the point that as long as you take care of your mitochondria as you care for a car's engine, it will provide the peak energy levels required for your maximum performance. 

  

**Symptoms that your brain isn't functioning as well as it could**

Things like forgetfulness, cravings, inability to focus, low energy, brain fog, fatigue, un-refreshing sleep, moodiness/anger, quick temper, are all possible symptoms of an inefficient brain, and therefore mitochondrial dysfunction. Causes are usually due to:

  

*   Nutritional deficiencies
*   Hormonal deficiencies
*   Toxins
*   Stress, depression
*   Chronic inflammation
*   Junk light

  

He dives deep into the science and biology of things, which I read but find it hard to remember (i.e. glazed over). Basic biology 101: mitochondria are ancient bacteria which became embedded into cells. These powerhouses take oxygen and create a substance known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a keystone ingredient we humans use for energy. We can live 3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, but without ATP we die within seconds. 

  

Many things can affect the mitochondria's efficiency in producing ATP. I was more interested on the practical to-dos of biohacking my brain:

  

### **Food**

*   Go low carb/sugar, because sugar is a less efficient fuel source than fat. But not lower than 20g of carbs per day.
*   Eating enough fats and the right kinds of fat is crucial to maintaining the myelin (the sheath of your brain's neurons). Having enough high-density cholesterol is key too - deficiency can cause cognitive decline. Go for coconut oil, MCT oil, grass-fed butter/meat, pastured egg yolks, olive oil, fish/krill oil, avocadoes, wild-caught low-mercury seafood. Avoid omega-6 fats, like vegetable and seed oils, fried foods. 
*   Eat prebiotics (fibre, bone broth) and probiotics (fermented foods) to maintain good microbiome (i.e. gut health), as new research shows how gut bacteria directly affects brain function.
*   Avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, as it wrecks your gut micorbiome. Ask your doctor if you really need cholesterol statins, antidepressants, anti-inflammatories, diabetic meds. 
*   Avoid oxidised fats (BBQ/fried foods, even pork rinds–a popular keto snack) and sugars as it causes inflammation in the body, reduce generation of new neurons (yes, your brain can grow new neurons!).
*   Coffee, dark chocolate, blueberries contains polyphenols which are essential to keep brain cells alive. Milk with your coffee makes the polyphenols less bioavailable (less absorbed), so try to go black.
*   Fasting helps with neurogenesis (creation of new brain cells). Try intermittent fasting, or periods of fasting.
*   Avoid inflammatory foods. These are inflammatory for nearly everyone - trans fats ("hydrogenated fats",oil in restaurant fryers), dairy, gluten, vegetable oils (canola, corn, peanut, soybean, sunflower oil).

  

### **Water**

*   Raw vegetables juices, fresh spring water and glacial meltwater contains a type of water (called exclusion zone water) that is critical to mitochondria function

  

### **Lifestyle/Exercise**

*   More exercise boosts neurogenesis. Fats burned during exercise also removes toxins (as that's where they are stored). 
*   Earthing - walking barefoot on ground, barefoot yoga or using an earthed mat or sauna for your bed to soak up the earth's negative charge (because the more negative charge your body has, the better functioning)
*   Cold showers, cold facial wash - cold therapy or cold thermeogenesis forces your body to create hear, burn fat and improve mitochondrial efficiency. It also helps relieve pain and reduces chronic inflammation.
*   Sweat in a sauna gets rid of toxins in your body.

  

### **Detox**

*   Avoid heavy metals such as lead and mercury, frequently found in farmed seafood, paint, fungicide, thermometers, batteries, fluorescent lightbulbs.
*   Avoid overripe fruits or vegetables.
*   Avoid moldy foods (obvious), but there's many foods that contain mold but not easily observed. Much of cereals and grains are moldy due to poor storage. It's not enough to avoid grains, but also those animals like pigs and cows which feed on grain (where mold toxins gets stored in their fats). Go for grass-fed or pasture-raised where possible.
*   Much of the commercial coffee we drink have mold due to poor processing and storage. 50% of brewed coffee are moldy. If you feel tired after drinking, it might be due to mold. Expensive or organic coffee doesn't mean it's mold-free. Look for single-estate, not blends (not mixed with moldy beans). Get washed coffee than natural-process coffee. Find coffee from Central America and from higher elevation.
*   Avoid dried fruit (sulfite toxins). Dry them yourself.
*   Wine and beer might also get contaminated by mold in the manufacturing process. European wines have stricter regulation so it's better. Alcohol in general causes oxidative stress in your body.
*   Go for European chocolate, as they have undergoes rigorous regulation. 
*   Go for nuts with skin on (not shell), and stored in fridge at the store.
*   Corn gets lots of fungicide, so try to avoid it as much as possible.
*   Artificial sweeteners, flavours, additives, MSG, soy sauce - all inflammatory.
*   Fluorinated water - use a filter to remove it.
*   GMO soybeans, corn. Best bet is to buy organic or buy from a local farmer.
*   Mercury levels are high in tilefish, swordfish, shark and mackerel. Avoid.
*   Dave Asprey considers sugar to be a common neurotoxin - causes insulin resistance, inflammation.
*   Environmental mold - if the room smells funky/like a mop, leave. Avoid water-damaged buildings (flood, leaks), water-stains on walls. Musty smell in hotel room - ask for a different room. Repair water leaks. Consider safer building materials. Ensure proper ventilation. Get a mold professional to inspect your home, and clean up professionally (improperly removing mold makes the spores airbourne - worse)  
*   Take detox supplements - activated charcoal, bentonite clay, grape seed extract, coconut oil, spirulina, chlorella.

  

### **Mental wellness**

*   Chronic stress leads to constantly elevated cortisol levels, leading to poor fat metabolism and sugar cravings. Have better stress management.
*   A fun environment that keeps one engaged and entertained enhances neuron development.

  

### **Light**

*   Some UV light exposure (30min per day) on your eyes and skin to enhance brain function.
*   Light therapy using infrared lights might ease healing and recharge your mitochondria. Use red LED lights.
*   Avoid junk light, i.e. blue light - it messes up your circadian rhythm and mitochondria efficiency. Use blue light screen protectors on your smartphone and laptops, get blue light lenses for glasses. Turn your screens to night mode (more yellow) to reduce strain on eyes. Avoid working in offices lit by bright white fluorescent lights. Find places with natural daylight, without glare.
