_Day 8 of the #200wad challenge._ 

  

Part 1 of a raw report card on my maker journey so far, in products made.  

  

First, some context: 2018 was a maker year for me. My very first year as an indie maker. In Feb, I made a commitment to launch one minimum viable product per month (#1mvp1month). This was inspired a lot by seeing what people were doing and making in the rapidly growing indie maker movement, in particular a few prominent makers like @levelsio, @yongfook, @marckohlbrugge. What they did, how they did it and most importantly, why they did what they did, resonated deeply with me. They made me think about my own dissatisfaction of how I'm not making much at all. I realised I hungered to create...stuff. Anything. (I wrote more [here](https://jasonleow.sg/310/1mvp1month/).) 

  

So, now that it's the end of the year, thought I'll do an overall recap, starting with the MVPs made so far:
