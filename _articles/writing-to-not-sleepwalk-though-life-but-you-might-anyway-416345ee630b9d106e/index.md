> _"The very reason I write is so that I might not sleepwalk through my entire life." - David Perrell_

  

That quote perfectly sums up my aspirations when it comes to writing daily here. So that I may live more consciously, with more self-awareness and intention. So that I reflect and introspect, rather than mindlessly living through the days. And indeed, on most days, the 200 word limit and the daily streak mechanism had worked as intended. Having to write daily—rain or shine—helps with conscious living. Having to write at least 200 words means I can't just mindlessly write something the length of a tweet or Facebook post and call it an exercise in reflection. Of course, if you spent effort and time to write a short poem or something well-thought through and unscrupulously edited, more power to you. Word quantity is a guide.

  

But that's just 80% of the time. The remaining 20% are just about showing up. Some days life happens, and you. Just. Cannot. Think. Nor. Write. Sleepwalking through the day's words is all you could muster. Fair enough. That happens. Cut yourself some slack, write what you need, go to sleep early. You live to fight another day.

  

But if I find the 20% growing; if I find myself sleepwalking through life and my words more and more often; if I just write to keep the streak, then the writing and the streak had just become tools to help me sleepwalk through life without guilt. 

  

The only common ground between the 80% and the 20% is that the intention stays the same. That you're committed to living a conscious life (or whatever goal you set out) through daily writing. That is a non-negotiable. 

  

My words, my posts, are really an affirmation and unwavering commitment to the daily practice of not sleepwalking. The content do not really matter, even if it helps. What matters is renewing that intention everyday. Day in, day out.
