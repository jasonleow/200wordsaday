There's a scene in Iron Man 3 where Tony Stark was having a panic attack from the work as a superhero, and he called Harley, the kid who sheltered him while he was hiding from his enemies. Harley goes console Stark, and said, "You're a mechanic, right? Why don't you _build something_?"

  

That line really stuck with me. Floated around in my subconscious. 

  

Then it appeared as a mini-epiphany. I'm not sure when this happened, but there's a repeating pattern that I observed about how I cope with crisis. And it's about _building something_.

  

First it was a chronic medical condition in 2018 (which I had since recovered from, thankfully). While I was seeking treatment, I wasn't taking on paid projects then, but I continued to work. In fact, it was that same time that I tried out the 12 startups in 12 months challenge. I called it [#1mvp1month](https://twitter.com/jasonleowsg/status/970890710751723521). I didn't end up making 12 products, but was close – 8 products. That was a strange experience, because on one hand, I was going through a low period in terms of health and mental wellbeing. But yet I was creating like nobody's business. 

  

Then in 2019, in a bid to get my health back, I turned to keto and intermittent fasting. Hard as f\*\*k, trying to stop eating carbs. But I did. In the process of changing my diet and my health, I made a product called Keto List – a directory of keto resources and links. That helped me in a big way, and now it's a little side business.

  

Then, COVID-19 came. Complete topsy-turvy of life. I'm safe at home, but also stuck at home. For someone who enjoys being outside, what can I do to cope? I create. Again. Since March, I had made [5 products](https://cowriters.app/words/altruistic-april-from-bored-to-swamped-392535e95a823ce484), like a man possessed. And still there's more products to come before the month ends. 

  

I realised that the intensity of my creating is directly proportional to how challenged I am in a crisis, or inversely proportional to how low I feel. I guess I needed something to balance it out. Creating always felt energizing and uplifting. It gives life, right when I need to feel more alive. It's like I can almost hear Harley say that to me over the phone (though I'm under no illusions of being a superhero):

  

_"You're a maker, right? Why don't you make something?"_

  

Damned hell I am.
