I'm a big fan of creative visualisation, especially for life goals, self-growth and career. Recently, @arthurkendall shared this exercise called [Segment Intending](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-fake-it-until-you-make-it-way-to-happiness-251225d55abd6ed5f9) which is a way to visualise your day, and to bring possible surprising results on your happiness and how your day turns out. Here's how he does it:

  

**Segment Intending for gratitude: Wouldn't it be nice if......?**

*   Break your day into segments - breakfast, commute, working on projects, lunch, etc
*   For each segment, ask yourself "Wouldn't it be nice if \_\_\_\_\_?" and fill in the gap with what you'd like to happen - like a traffic free commute, a smooth and productive couple of hours working on your projects or a happy social lunch.

  

I love this! The fact that it's framed as a question, makes it all the more powerful I feel. It stirs up possibilities and hope. It remains open, instead of fixed if it's said in an affirmative way. It gently nudges reality and asks if it is willing to go our way.

  

So here's my attempt at visualising my perfect day:

  

*   Wouldn't it be nice if I woke up the the blue light of dawn feeling rested, refreshed and excited to start my day?
*   Wouldn't it be nice if I felt a deep centering of peace and calm after my morning meditation?
*   Wouldn't it be nice if I felt an embodied sense of well-being after my morning workout and breakfast?
*   Wouldn't it be nice if the day went by effortlessly in deep work, and I finish feeling productive and satisfied with what I completed for the day?
*   Wouldn't it be nice if I had a fun, heart-warming dinner with my family at the end of a good day's work?
*   Wouldn't it be nice if I had loving conversations with my wife before bedtime?
