It's so quiet. Too quiet. 

  

It's always unsettling to arrive at your destination in the dead of the night. I can't see anything outside of the window, and it feels the darkness of the night is staring back at you. It doesn't help that huge fish tank-like windows line the entire wall. I close the curtains for a facade of security. 

  

Better to choose sleep, on first nights. 

  

......

  

Waking up though, it was completely different. Light streaming through the curtains, gently nudging me, waking me. Last night was the best sleep I had in months, and I can guess why. That quiet darkness was womb-like. Hardly a sound of traffic, an occasional frog or cricket call. Sleep was so delicious, I snuggle back under the blankets some more. The day can wait.

  

Soon, I can hear the faint chorus of bells and prayers coming from the nearby village temple. The yoga studio next door plays a soft lullaby, reaching my doors like gentle waves lapping on the shore. That was my cue to finally get up. I part the curtains, Hollywood-style. And gosh, that view. My apartment is by a hillside with an unobstructed view, so I can see across to Ubud town – a luscious green canopy spreading all the way, with islands of orange-top village homes and the sporadic temple spire poking out. It's a clear day today. And on good days, Bali's holiest mountain Mount Agung will grant us with a sacred appearance. An auspicious omen to come.

  

It's a large, comfortable apartment. Everything I need for a personal retreat – a desk facing the expansive view, a large soft bed for great sleep, air-conditioned comfort everywhere, a fridge and a pantry for sustenance at hand, and restaurants just minutes away to keep me fed. 

  

OK, I'm all set for you, 2019. Let's see what you'd shown me all year.
