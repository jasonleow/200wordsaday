The best trick to do when you're stuck and unsure what to write for the day, is to write about why you're stuck, how you're feeling about it, and what you can try to do.

  

I'd been having a slump week so far, so I know haha. It sucks. I really want to keep writing. I love my streak. But the well is dry. Bone dry! But reading the main feed, I realised others seem to be doing that too! @abrahamKim just wrote [something](https://200wordsaday.com/words/struggling-to-enjoy-writing-88255c641257d5a40) today about struggling to write. @brandonwilson wrote a fantastic [reply](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-losing-steam-on-200wad-86175c620de5db30c) to my "struggling to write" post a few days ago, though it probably wasn't because he was stuck. And check out this hilarious but creative [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-m-so-tired-84655c6071505087d) by @lucjah - I love it! "I'm sooo tired" hahahaha. Awesome! Apparently, this trick is an open secret already.

  

I think it happens to be a great way to get unstuck, by exploring and asking questions about the 'stuckiness'. Maybe questioning the situation and surfacing your feelings about it makes it more salient, and salience makes slumps easier to recognise and accept.Â 

  

Like they say in therapy, the first step to recovery is to recognise that you have a 'problem'!
