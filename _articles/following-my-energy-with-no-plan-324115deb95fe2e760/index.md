_**What if I cast aside all plans and deadlines into the wind, and just followed my energy instead?**_

  

This question had been burning inside me since a very special and inspiring month of [October](https://200wordsaday.com/words/play-october-wrap-up-sparking-joy-in-work-301995dbbff3614d37) where I experimented with learning how to spark joy in my work. I learned how to follow my energy, curiosity, excitement, instead of a plan:

  

> _I followed where my_ [_energy flowed_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-7-types-of-rest-292805da9cef5ae7f2)_, and avoided where my energy stalled. Often, I would conduct_ [_mind-body scans_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/how-to-inject-more-joy-into-work-1-body-scans-286515d9de93e48fa6) _at the start of the day, and then I followed my energy for the day. That energy can be curiosity or excitement, or it can be fatigue or indecision. When there's excitement, I ride the wave and work with it. Productivity often improves without trying. When my energy stalls, I often_ [_walked it out_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/solvitur-ambulando-it-is-solved-by-walking-296765db1b3793b9f4) _- "solvitur ambulando" - or_ [_work offline_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-deliberate-practice-of-working-offline-282205d949c934a1e4)_._

  

Since I'm working on my own products right now, with no deadlines for others, I thought I can leverage on the privilege of discarding all plans aside. Doesn't it sound like an intriguing and formative experiment?! I feel enthused just by thinking about it. 

  

Because even though I didn't plan anything or have deadlines in October, I made Keto List Singapore, and played around with the idea for Sweet Jam Sites. In ONE month! With NO plans and deadlines! On the other hand, when I did have plans in the month after, in November, I didn't come up with anything, and struggled to finish up stuff on time. How strange. This is so counter to how I am used to working, yet the results seems to speak for itself. It could just be a coincidence of course, or it's easier starting projects than running them. Hard to tell unless I repeat the experiment again, to follow my energy.

  

What does following my energy mean anyway?

  

*   If I feel eager/excited/enthused/curious to explore something, I go for it.
*   If I feel tired, sleepy or stuck while working, I stop.
*   If I'm hungry, I stop working and eat.
*   If I feel restless while working, I stand up or walk around.
*   If I'm unsure what to do for a particular task or project, I walk and think.
*   If my eyes tire from staring at the screen for too long, I work offline.
*   If there's something else more important besides work happening, I give it my fullest attention instead of work.

  

The list is reminiscent of a Zen story I came across, about aimlessness and the practice of non-practice: 

  

> _A student once asked his teacher, "Master, what is enlightenment?"  
> The master replied, "When hungry, eat. When tired, sleep."_

  

I can't say I'm going for enlightenment in this experiment. My objectives are a lot more profane than sacred. But I can certainly do "when hungry, eat", "when tired, stop work".
