Her words gave me the feels. Only because it resonated so deeply. The topics we chose to write about here had been instrumental in nudging us towards our goals. Topics like:

  

*   Monthly goals/experiments we're trying
*   Introspective reviews and observations of what we did for the month
*   Habits we are trying to make or break
*   Other/Larger goals in life we're trying to achieve
*   Insights we learned and mistakes we made trying to do any of the above
*   Celebrating wins, milestones, actions taken for any of the above
*   Books we read that inspired us with regard to any of the above
*   Commenting, discussing, encouraging others on the same journey

  

Imagine the power of writing everyday on what you wish to achieve, dreams you wish to fulfil, habits you wish to form. Then imagine the power of dripping water on a rock. Nothing happens today, tomorrow, the week after. Not much difference observable after a month, even. But give it months and years, and the water drills a hole through the rock. Just water. Fluid. Soft. No hardness to speak of. But punching through a rock, just drip by drip, compounded over time. 

  

In fact, writing everyday about your dreams has probably much better wish-fulfilling efficacy than water punching through rock drip by drip. @keni had experienced it. I did too. I think @brandonwilson did too. We were here for just over one year, and already it's showing through, if not tangible results, at least the optimism and confidence to achieve it.

  

If we keep writing about it, it'll happen. It has to. And it will.
