I made a new thing today, again. After making [Tools For COVID19](https://sheet2site.com/s/toolsforcovid19/) using sheet2site the other day, I thought about what else I can do to help, but wasn’t sure how my skills can come in useful. Call it boredom, or call it leveraging on inspiration or the need of the times. The pandemic situation seems to be completely occupying my mindspace, so rather than let it get me down, maybe I can transmute the energy to create things that might come in useful. There's many things I can't control now, but I can control how I want to respond from the energy that's there.

  

But witnessing the many civic/tech initiatives rising out to fill gaps, I realised I can help by doing what I'm already doing: building websites. I can build sites for the ones doing good. Help those who help others.

  

So here’s it: I’ll build a COVID-19-related website for you **in a day**, for FREE. Anything that would help people:

  

*   Be more informed
*   Be more supported, socially or emotionally
*   Feel safer
*   Get the supplies they need

  

Yes, FREE. As in free beer. This can feel like a scam, but it isn't. I just like to run businesses that are more socially conscious and willing to contribute back to the community. The only catch is it just has to be for causes to help anyone struggling during this pandemic. Anything related to COVID-19, or the second and third order effects spinning out from it.

  

It can be sites to help individuals, seniors, parents get the right facts and information on how to best protect themselves and their loved ones. It can be community boards showing offers and requests. It can even be for businesses struggling in the economic fallout. Any entity welcomed – NGO, not-for-profit, or just a ground-up community/volunteer-run effort. You could be a solo developer, indie maker or aspiring entrepreneur with a brilliant idea to plug a gap that you see in your hood, city or country. 

  

When mobilizing resources to help your community, time is of the essence. It can be a matter of life or death, considering how the virus can affect those who are particularly vulnerable. That's why I'm building the websites in a day, using a CMS that's easy to pick up, so you don't have to fiddle and fumble around trying to learn a new interface, and instead can better focus on helping your community.

  

With everyone home, networks might get spotty and people might not be able to access the information they need. That's why building this websites as static sites will help people get on your site fast, and secure.

  

So please do forward this to anyone you know who might benefit from getting a free COVID-19-related website up fast. Contact me here, at the [Sweet Jam Sites/COVID-19 landing page](https://sweetjamsites.com/covid-19/). 

  

Happy to help!
