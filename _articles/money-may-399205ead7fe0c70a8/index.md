I think I had fun in April. Maybe too much fun. 

  

And too little money.

  

I took the month off in April to try to learn how to cope with the worsening economic and social situation in Singapore. I offered my mind, body and spirit to help make a difference. And looking back, I did. At least that little bit of what one man can do.

  

But as I watch my savings dwindle without any gigs on the horizon, and with a newborn and rest of family to care for, things are beginning to feel a little desperate. The urgency is creeping in, surely. And I can't keep waiting for normal to return, because even after our lockdown lifts, things may not go back to normal. Gigs may not return. Workplaces might still be under stringent, safe distancing measures that do not allow for face-to-face consultancy work. So I really need to pivot. I already have some side hustles like Sweet Jam Sites and Keto List. I have one or two good indie product ideas to pursue that can become my main hustle rather than side one. I just need to double down on that path that I had already started on, even before the pandemic. Freelance gigs, product business, anything that would allow me to be [pandemic-proof](https://cowriters.app/words/how-does-one-become-pandemic-proof-in-work-397975ea99b7c426c5). Find **at least one gig** that pays, and **grow one product**—existing or new—that people will pay for, that I can foresee making a living off from.

  

In March, I failed at my [Moolah March](https://cowriters.app/words/moolah-march-wrap-up-387005e83555582c1b) monthly goal because of the pandemic, so now is also a good time to revisit that goal of learning to invest, and **commit a small, non-zero amount of funds into investment**. The funds are sitting there in my government pension fund account anyway, so might as well use it. It's still a good time to get in on the market. I want to try.

  

So **Money May** it will be. A month of refocusing back on making money, from my products and gigs. Money may come, money may not, but if I sat around waiting for the virus to blow over, it certainly will not.
