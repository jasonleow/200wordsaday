This is the chapter with a practical habit forming/goal visualisation hack: writing down your goal statement and repeating it everyday to "auto-suggest" to your subconscious to create the reality distortion needed to achieve your goals. Interesting, it explains the dynamics of the psychology behind it – how and why repeating a sentence daily will help you achieve your goal. Thanks to this chapter, I created my goal statement (latest iteration):

  

> I will **earn $1mil revenue** by the 1 Jan 2021. In return, I will **have fun** working on my indie products, adhere to a **healthy, millionaire habit** system, and I will **surrender**.

  

More notes below. Sharing them here as reference for myself, and for anyone who might find it useful. This is not a book review, just raw notes lifted directly from the book, with some minor edits, interpretations and categorisations of my own.

**Think And Grow Rich (3)**

  

**(3) Auto-suggestion: The medium for influencing the subconscious mind, the third step to riches**

  

AUTO-SUGGESTION is the agency of control through which an individual may voluntarily feed his subconscious mind on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way into this rich garden of the mind.

  

This is a fact of such importance as to warrant repetition in practically every chapter, because the lack of understanding of this is the main reason the majority of people who try to apply the principle of auto-suggestion get no desirable results. Plan, unemotional words do not influence the subconscious mind. You will get no appreciable results until you learn to reach your subconscious mind with thoughts, or spoken words which have been well emotionalized with BELIEF.

  

Your ability to use the principle of auto-suggestion will depend, very largely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until that desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION.

  

Fix your own mind the EXACT amount of money you desire, hold your thoughts on that amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with your eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the money. Do this at least once each day. As you go through these exercises, follow the instructions given in the chapter on FAITH, and see yourself actually IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY!

  

DO NOT WAIT for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING meanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you need. Be on alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into ACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably "flash" into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of "inspiration."... Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success.

  

Do not trust to your "reason" when creating your plan for accumulating money through the transmutation of desire. Your reason is faulty. Moreover, your reasoning faculty may be lazy, and, if you depend entirely upon it to serve you, it may disappoint you. 

  

When visualizing the money you intend to accumulate (with closed eyes), see yourself rendering the service, or delivering the merchandise you intend to give in return for this money. This is important!

  

Write down the your purpose like that:

  

"By 1 Jan 2021, I will have in my possession $1mil. In return, I will give the mosy efficient service of which I am capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of an indie maker. 

  

I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands. It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in proportion that I deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is received."

  

Read this chapter/statement aloud once every night, until you become thoroughly convinced that the principle of auto-suggestion is sound, that it will accomplish for you all that has been claimed for it. As you read, underscore with a pencil every sentence which impresses you favourably.
