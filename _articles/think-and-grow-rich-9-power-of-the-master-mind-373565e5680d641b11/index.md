I heard about Master Minds a lot, but initial impressions just bring to mind boys' clubs and the Illuminati. So perhaps its reputation precedes itself, in a less wholesome way. But I can imagine how a group of close friends—in a spirit of brotherhood/sisterhood—can actively support and push each other towards their own goals.

  

Then the author starts talking about "spiritual units of energy" from each member's mind coming together, and generating the overall psychic energy level and makes it available to everyone in the group. Kind of like a campfire where everyone tosses in their single piece of firewood, and the resultant blaze is warms than any single fire that each might have made with their own tiny piece of wood.

  

I can accept that as an analogy. Not sure where he based these bits of new age writings from, but it'll be so fascinating to do a bit of investigation into his sources. 

  

More notes below. Sharing them here as reference for myself, and for anyone who might find it useful. This is not a book review, just raw notes lifted directly from the book, with some minor edits, interpretations and categorisations of my own.

**Think And Grow Rich (9):**

**Power of the Master Mind, the ninth step to riches**

  

Power may be defined as "organized and intelligently directed KNOWLEDGE." Power, as a term is here used, refers to ORGANIZED effort, sufficient to enable an individual to transmute DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. ORGANIZED effort is produced through the coordination of effort of two or more people, who work toward a DEFINITE end, in the spirit of harmony.

  

**The Master Mind**

The two characteristics of the Master Mind principle, one of which is economic in nature, and the other psychic. The economic feature is obvious. Economic advantages may be created by any person who surrounds himself with advice, counsel, and personal cooperation of a group of men who are willing to lend him wholehearted aid, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY. This form of cooperative alliance has been the basis of nearly every great fortune.

  

The psychic phase of the Master Mind principle is much more abstract, much more difficult to comprehend, because it has reference to the spiritual forces with which the human race, as a whole, is not well acquainted. When the minds of two people are coordinated in a SPIRIT OF HARMONY, the spiritual units of energy of each mind form an affinity, which constitutes the "psychic" phase of the Master Mind. When a group of individual brains are coordinated and function in Harmony, the increased energy created through that alliance, becomes available to every individual brain in the group. "Men take on the nature and the habits and the POWER OF THOUGHT of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony."

  

Money is as shy and elusive as the "old time" maiden. It must be wooed and won by methods not unlike those used by a determined lover, in pursuit of the girls of his choice. And, coincidental as it is, the POWER used in the "wooing" of money is not greatly different from that used in wooing a maiden. 

  

Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it. because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be "attracted". ANYBODY can WISH for riches, and most people do, but only a few know that a definite plan, plus a BURNING DESIRE for wealth, are the only dependable means of accumulating wealth.
