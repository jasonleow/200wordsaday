[@seunoyebode](https://200wordsaday.com/words/ideas-gen-225065d2a4c328da4f) mentioned about keeping up a regular practice of generating ideas for possible products to create (as part of being an entrepreneur), and we got talking about our own practices.

  

I had been keeping a "Pains & Frustrations Idea Journal" for about a year now. It's the one place where I log painful and frustrating moments that I encounter when using products and services. It's been fun and useful, because at least I have somewhere for it now, whereas previously it used to be everywhere - in emails, notes app, different reader apps, etc. And definitely cathartic, because writing down these frustrations is like venting. When I develop an idea around the frustration, it also confers a sense of control to the situation, that I can do something about it (now or at least future). So far I had made a grand total of... ONE product from the list, and in process of starting on another one. So it's paid off (somewhat)!  

  

How I go about my practice of idea journalling:

  

**Inspiration sources**

1.  Pains/frustrations I experience with products and services
2.  Twitter hashtag [#requestforstartups](https://twitter.com/hashtag/requestforstartups) or [#requestforproducts](https://twitter.com/hashtag/requestforproduct)
3.  Ideas I get from forums like Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, reddit.

  

**What to write about**

I first talk about the problem, the background context and my painpoints. I have some prompter questions on the first page of the notebook to help me think through:

*   Pain level: How much pain is this problem causing me?
*   Frequency: How frequently am I dealing with this problem?
*   Popularity: How many others is this problem impacting?
*   Value: How likely am I to pay someone to solve this problem?

You can quantify it on a scale of 1 to 10 if you like, or just write anecdotally about it. After I elucidate the problem, I write down what the idea looks like, broadly. I try to keep it one page, one problem-idea. Cross it out with "DONE" if you did end up making it. 

  

**No filtering**

It's a very mixed bag of dumb and interesting ideas, and sometimes dumb ideas become interesting too, at a later time. I don't filter when writing, so everything goes in so that I can relook at old ideas with fresh eyes each time.

  

**How often**

I do this whenever I bump up against a painful or frustrating moment using a product or service. I try to flip through it every month or so, and try to add ideas as much as I can.

  

Tools

I use a [Field Notes memo book](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) for my ideas. It's expensive compared to the generic ones you can get from a typical bookstore, but I love the product back story, and their dedication and creativity that they bring to their craft. Every season (spring, summer, autumn, winter) they release a new design, and I buy the ones I like. I enjoy the small, passport size of it - with the size gives it a kind of affordance and semiotics, a sense of taking notes when out in the field, while on the go. I find that gels well with the on-the-go nature of ideas journalling.
