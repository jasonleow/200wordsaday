We're just a one or two months into this pandemic, and already the makers are out in full force. What caught my interest recently were the analog and hardware products that's been blooming up. Urban survival gear fit for a pandemic.

I love this. It looks like a visor cap, but extended all the way down your face. And it's cheap too! This piece of unassuming plastic is similar to some of the gear that medical pros wear. Perfect if you have to take the train, worried about closer distancing, and want to protect yourself a little more from coughs and sneezes from passengers standing too close by.

This little brass key chain doesn't look like much initially, but there's a heft to it that's gorgeous in it's own right. The gold-like sheen does help make it look lux too. But aesthetics aside, it's actually a very practical tool. You can press lift buttons with it, hook on door handles, and even use it to sign on a digital signature pad! I'd been using my keys and an un-used stylus these days to press buttons, but this looks like an easy addition to any key chain.

And what about touching our faces? Of all the different hygiene habits to pick up now, not touching our faces is probably the hardest one of them all. We touch our faces all day, all the time, unknowingly. So how do you create greater self-awareness for something which bypasses most of our conscious awareness the whole day? Enter Immutouch. It's a smart wearable on your wrist, which buzzes when you touch or come close to touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. A companion app helps you track your progress too!Â
