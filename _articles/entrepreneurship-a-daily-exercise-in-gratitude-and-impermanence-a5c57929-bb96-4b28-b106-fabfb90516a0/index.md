Today on Twitter: 

> Variable income is thrilling. Every day starts at zero, and it’s always a pleasant surprise when the day doesn’t also end at zero. Very hard to take it for granted (unlike my old steady paycheck). ~ [@dvassallo](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1320225863581851649?s=28)

Indeed...so many entrepreneurs press the reset button every day on their income, and hope for the best the next day. I struck me how we have to practice being comfortable with impermanence. That our incomes are not promised tomorrow. That fires might suddenly start burning somewhere along your business supply chain and the next day you'll be without a business. That customers can choose to churn at whim, without notice, and often you won't even have the privilege of closure of knowing why. Everyday, a new day, a ground zero day! It can be scary for some, especially those who are beholden to stability. But for those entrepreneurial types who love doing new things everyday, it's perfect. Hard, but perfect. 

Entrepreneurship can also be a daily exercise in gratitude. You start the day at zero, but it didn't end in a zero. That's something to be thankful for! That the universe moved things and people around and you ended up with some cash. Sure, it came from your effort too, but any good entrepreneur will tell you, hard work and effort isn't enough in itself. So it's a great chance to be grateful for being provided in ways we still can't and never will fathom.

Impermanence. Gratitude.
