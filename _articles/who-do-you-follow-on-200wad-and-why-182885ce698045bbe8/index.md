I was checking out the new Profile page layout and clicked on the Following tab. Realised I was following some folks who had stopped writing, and decided to do some spring cleaning of my follow list. I like doing this on my social feeds from time to time, not just on 200wad, but also on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  

  

It's just...cathartic to trim down, to let go of the old, give way to new. So after trimming, I was left with only 3 folks, out of which only one is still writing (occasionally). I'm hoping that they would consider coming back by tagging them in this! ;)

  

[@kp](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/kp) - I enjoy kp's writings. He often talks about stuff that I'm always interested in to read more about, like [compassion](https://200wordsaday.com/words/what-exactly-is-compassion-1155c0184742eb76), [how to benefit others](https://200wordsaday.com/words/understanding-how-i-can-benefit-others-9275c17d07b55fbf), [daily affirmations](https://200wordsaday.com/words/on-daily-affirmations-42155c3d58eeb5233). These days, everything viral on the web is fake, taps on outrage, or just fighting. Lots and lots of fighting. So his posts are refreshing because it's hard to find content like that, and people who are committed to write about it. Too bad he stopped writing here. Thankfully he's quite active on Twitter. 

  

[@lexc](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/lexc) - lex was one of the early pioneers on this site. I enjoyed her first post about [Malaysian food](https://200wordsaday.com/words/m-is-for-malaysian-meals-20865c2db692e3bb7) - that was the post that got me sitting up. I'm Singaporean after all, and being neighbours, we share much similar culinary heritage and experiences. What followed were a couple more posts - [A “Westernized” Asian’s Relationship with Food](https://200wordsaday.com/words/a-westernized-asian-s-relationship-with-food-27875c3168994f507), and [Dinners](https://200wordsaday.com/words/dinners-38505c39b71a39742). I feel we don't write enough about delicious food experiences in 200wad! The glutton in me always loves a good food post. Her descriptive style is something that I enjoy reading and writing about, so it clicks for me. It's a pity she stopped writing here since March. 

  

[@daniellucas](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/daniellucas) - I always look forward to Daniel's posts. Vivid and lively imagery and metaphors, silky smooth prose, beautiful, delightful accounts of his experiences of watching the [rain](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-draft-115385c80a93f82fba) and [clouds](https://200wordsaday.com/words/nimbus-maybe-180975ce4a3ea57ffb),  about [subjective time](https://200wordsaday.com/words/subjective-time-173535cd9fc5e8309d), and [being](https://200wordsaday.com/words/a-being-being-126085c9086c1edaba). Apparently he writes for a living, so that explains the mastery! His writing style is something I would love to emulate and learn from. My limited vocabulary pales in comparison. So Dan if you're reading this, please keep writing. It matters to some of us here.

  

So, who do you follow on 200wad, and why?
