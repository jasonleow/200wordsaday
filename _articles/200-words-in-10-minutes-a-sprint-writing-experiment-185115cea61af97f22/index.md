The 10-minute, 200-word post. No pre-determined topic. No prompters. Just a stream-of-consciousness piece. Here goes.Â

It's the weekend. Sundays are lazy days, but we work anyway. In a lazy way. We make our way to our favourite cafe. It's lovely to spend time here, staring out through the glass walls. The double height ceiling, the white standing desks, the Japanese minimalist inspired setting, makes for a great way to just spend the day, daydreaming, looking at my journal, past photos, work to-dos. Just grazing leisurely here and there, on random stuff. No pushing towards a deadline. No pressure. Just boredom. Lots of boredom. Good boredom, probably. I think sometimes we pace ourselves too tightly during the week, and don't leave an opportunity for the mind and body to catch a breath. Especially the mind. Downtime. Screen saver mode. Lazy sloth boredom. And it's important that in this boring state that we don't stuff ourselves full with consumption - too much TV, screen time and mental stimulation takes away all that rest. Yes, boredom is rest for the mind. We're usually too productive to see it and want it. But that's the way it has to be. Just be bored. It's okay. It's alright. The mind will thank you for it after a Sunday of boredom, bouncing back with more energy in the new week.
