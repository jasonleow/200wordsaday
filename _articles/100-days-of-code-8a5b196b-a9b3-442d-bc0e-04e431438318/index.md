So here I am. My proudest streak yet:

**Day 100 of daily coding for at least one hour everyday.**

I wrote about my daily code streak frequently, recounting my experience month by month. It had the roller-coaster highs and lows similar to a typical budding romance, almost! 

**21 July** - [first steps](https://writelier.com/new-streak-daily-code-like-daily-bread-430775f16e10453be0), with excitement and trepidation. Learned that [I don't have to finish any online course](https://writelier.com/you-have-my-permission-to-not-finish-any-coding-classes-433055f1ee1f7e9389). Thinking about learning [by-products as products](https://writelier.com/byproducts-as-products-434145f22c49daf292). 

**21 Aug** - [first month](https://writelier.com/a-month-of-daily-code-441465f3e7b921a8b8), jumping out of bed for code, learning Vue, Nuxt, playing in Codepen. Learned how to [ask questions](https://writelier.com/rubber-ducking-and-rebooting-449505f5776ad3b93e), rubber ducking and rebooting. Making my [first API-first app](https://writelier.com/i-made-an-api-first-app!-061d6444-54d8-438d-81a9-12ae31448baa)!

**21 Sep** \- [second month](https://writelier.com/two-months-of-daily-code-254d8f0d-90db-4106-be1d-317368fc6e92), feeling the intense highs from building, diving deeper into Rails API. Learned [not to be lazy](https://writelier.com/don't-be-lazy-especially-if-you-knew-better-e332e90e-2241-4226-a397-3a8f31bd5866), especially if I knew better. [Fun detours](https://writelier.com/taking-fun-detours-is-also-progress-589708ee-08d5-442d-86bf-75b44175bc20) are a necessary part of the learning/coding process. Discovering my [kid in a candy store moment](https://writelier.com/what's-your-kid-in-a-candy-store-moment-for-work-a4f371d6-5eed-4d98-8762-4f02db137aa0) in coding, and the [softer (but just as important) parts of coding](https://writelier.com/decoding-the-soft-parts-of-coding-1d82dafd-ebce-4ff8-bef6-18b7554f8c99). And [the most important thing I do for the day](https://writelier.com/the-most-important-thing-first-thing-in-the-morning-79ca93d1-81f3-4cd6-81fa-86d80d723ec0) is coding.

**21 Oct** - [third month](https://writelier.com/three-months-of-daily-code-22fbd8f9-dcde-434b-a991-1bfbe652e430), maturing and easing into a stable routine, with less highs, more lows. Learning about [tech choice overload](https://writelier.com/tech-stack-choice-overload-01a208fa-8970-4397-a34e-6540348fa508) and how to think about what tech to use, and rebounding back and forth between Rails and Node.js/Strapi \[[1](https://writelier.com/bye-strapi-hello-rails-(again)-69bc1104-e225-4dd0-9dc5-68f7c1b847ac)\] \[[2](https://writelier.com/current-answer-to-%22what-programming-language-should-i-learn%22-5fb8eb8c-d03c-48c1-87cf-a42f6bfb21d4)\] \[[3](https://writelier.com/new-is-easy-better-is-hard-b3dfa923-7edb-441e-910b-63a7997fe4fb)\] \[[4](https://writelier.com/oh-what-the-hell-strapi-b12134f1-86d3-4e06-9498-12713da21e08)\].

**29 Oct** - 100 days of code, today. Diving into the messy backend world of SQL and query languages. 

_"A year from now, you'll wish you had started today." - Tony Robbins_

Indeed, Mr Robbins. 100 days ago, I wished I had started, just as I did many times before. But that time, these words got me - "Easy or not, time will pass anyway." And I acted on that wish, and I'm so glad now that I did.
