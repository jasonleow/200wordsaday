Somehow I've been having cravings for a good cookie recently. A cookie that's chunky, not thin; chewy, not powdery; toasty and warm, not cold and flaccid; crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. Something that looks ugly, lumpy, rustic and hand-made. And definitely keto-compliant. 

I don't take nor want to take mainstream cookies anymore due to my keto diet practice, and it feels like many past lives ago since I last tasted a proper chocolate chip cookie. The problem is that many keto chocolate chip cookies use almond flour, so the texture and structure changes, and often they end up powdery and dry, or too nutty (due to almond).

For the life of me, I can't pin down how the craving emerged out of nowhere...but now I remember that it's likely to do with this [Indie Hackers interview with Sam Eaton](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/166-sam-eaton-of-crave-cookie ), a developer who teamed up with his sister to start Crave Cookie, which now makes $200k per month. It must be the combination of delicious-looking cookies (they have an [awesome IG account](https://www.instagram.com/cravecookie/?hl=en)), great software, and an awesome indie hacker business. Ticks off all my desire weak spots. 

Someday, I'd love to start an indie business that's related to cookies and software. 

Managing cookies online, dealing out cookies offline.
