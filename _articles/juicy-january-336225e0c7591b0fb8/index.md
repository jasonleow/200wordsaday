It's 2020! A new year, new decade. And also January - time for monthly goals.

  

Last month, I learned that making something that someone would use is way different from making something that someone would [willingly pay for](https://200wordsaday.com/words/making-something-you-would-use-is-different-from-making-something-you-would-pay-for-329765df8bc99d569d). I [mentioned earlier](https://200wordsaday.com/words/3-skills-to-focus-on-in-2020-330705dfad0401f092) that I have a subconscious aversion to selling, therefore suck at monetization and marketing. I wish to get better at it, I really do. 

  

While I'm not entirely sure if any of the products I made is fundamentally something that users would willingly pay for, I can always experiment and find out. I intend to slow down development of new features on my current products, and just try to sell whatever I've got. **I want to see if I can get out of my comfort zone and learn this vital entrepreneurial skill of selling.** This month, my intention is to dive deeper into everything marketing and monetization: 

  

*   growth hacking, and how to set up acquisition channels
*   content marketing, to provide value and get the product in front of potential customers
*   conversion funnels, to convert interested shoppers into paying customers
*   monetization strategies, or how to get people to open up their wallets

  

[@GoodMarketingHQ](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ) has a whole bunch of awesome, no-BS sort of marketing examples that works. I'll be referring to that playbook for sure, to try out some of the marketing experiments listed. _Anyone knows any other marketing/monetization resources that work?_

  

So, more marketing and monetization, less development. More moolah juice. It's _**Juicy January**_ this month.
