I recently learned these two words from a friend who's into biohacking. He related his own experience of doing fasting, and how he went from having no boundaries between work and life, to now having no 'choice' but be dictated by what his body needs for optimal health. 

  

It's as if the body had awakened to its own power, and now has a voice that makes us do what it needs to thrive. On the outside, it looks like we simply start to take heed and listen to the body, rather than drive it like a slave to your goals and ambitions. 

  

Indeed, once I ceded ground in my priorities and my mind to my body and my health, I now cannot help but get stopped by my body whenever I push myself too hard. Just like this month. Strained a muscle during a workout. Getting ill again. Feeling low energy and hardly operating at peak. 

  

The body is my harshest teacher. 

  

All these are signals telling me I'm doing something wrong. AGAIN. And I cannot help but hear and heed. It sounds like it's an intellectual choice, but it isn't. Intellect has nothing here. A certain somatic/bodily wisdom is at play here. 

  

A somatic awakening.
