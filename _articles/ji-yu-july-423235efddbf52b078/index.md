In Mandarin, "加油" (pinyin: jiā yóu) taken literally means "add oil". It means to work harder, to buck up. Usually it's said in the context of encouraging someone, to fire them up, motivate them.

  

And I does feel like I need to take a month this time to encourage myself, especially after a [June](https://cowriters.app/words/june-wrap-up-active-inaction-422925efc87da0ea7e) of half-driven starts and half-hearted stops, unable to get into deep rest but 'unwilling' to get started too.

  

**What can one do to encourage oneself?** 

  

Is it the little things? Like [clear your desk](https://cowriters.app/words/clutter-outside-clutter-inside-413415edceadd52e11), cook a nice healthy meal, go for a run? Basically self-care?

  

Or is it the big things? Like day-dreaming about aspirations and ambitions, reading biographies of interesting and productive entrepreneurs, chatting with successful makers on Indie Hackers?

  

Or is it none of the above, but something deeper? Like taking long solo walks, alone time to reconnect with oneself, meditate, write, listen to music? 

  

It feels like the third option, because when my spirit refuses to move, nothing material moves either. No work, no gigs, no money, no goals, no achievements. I can see hints of the world moving on already, and windows of opportunities opening and closing before my eyes. But I don't feel driven to fight for them. 

  

So, yes. Jiā Yóu July is about quieting down even further. To listen inwards. To hear what it's been saying all along. 

  

STOP.
