@fyodor shared an interesting [book recommendation](https://200wordsaday.com/words/reasons-for-starting-up-300555db9077a9cfce) which I want to read now, a book called _Start Small, Stay Small_ by Rob Walling. It's a guide for software developers to launching their startup. Something about the three reasons he shared for wanting to start up resonated with me. It was simple and clear. That was refreshing to read.

  

Because truth is, I had written a lot about my goals here on 200wad. And now that I'm in the deep dive into doing, all the initial clarity around my goals are starting to feel hazy. It feels like I need a quick reboot, to refresh that clarity and simplicity.

  

Why do I want to start up? Basically, **freedom**.

  

**Creative freedom -** 

Over what I work on, how I do it, with whom, and where. I want total control over my destiny, and not have to depend on the whims and fancies of someone else (a boss). I recognise that I will still have customers with whims and fancies, but that's fine, because with customers, it can be a mutually beneficial exchange (at least you have more control to shape it to be that way), while with employers, it is often not the case.Â 

  

**Financial freedom -**

I want financial freedom to support a more-than-comfortable lifestyle that I want for myself and my family. There's a hard cap on accumulating wealth when you work for someone. There's limited positions going up, HR sets a pay ceiling, economic recessions means retrenchments, less bonuses, etc. But starting up, while there's risk of losing all my money, but the financial upside is potentially unlimited. Or at the very least, many multiples higher than when employed. Worst case scenario: I can always go back to employment if I fail, so no irreparable, permanent harm there.

  

**Freedom from ill-being -** 

After years in employment, I recognise that the office schedule and work space isn't the best for my health, in body and mind. Too sedentary, too long hours, too much 'busy work', too much office politics, too stressful. Of course, organisations differ, but I'd dare say, with limited range of variation. Best way for my health is my own way. No amount of wealth or freedom will help if I don't have health to enjoy them.
