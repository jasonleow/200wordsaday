@abrahamKim did an interesting [exercise](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-how-do-i-make-a-million-dollars-3-218115d1f55dc78a46) based on my calculations of how many customers do I need to make a million dollars:   

  

> I'm replying to this as a consumer in the market. I wanted to respond by letting both you and @seun know for research purposes what I as a consumer would be willing to pay for each track.

  

He asked about our own versions, so here it is, plus some new ideas:

  

**Get 50 people to pay $1,666/month for 12 months.** 

\- I pay around this amount in groceries and food. Perhaps a grocery delivery subscription? The common necessities that don't vary much per month perhaps? I don't own a car, but this is probably the costs of upkeeping a car in terms of tax and fuel.

  

**Get 100 people to pay $833/month for 12 months.** 

\-  This is the range that I pay for my home loan payments. A mortgage or home loan financial management SaaS product perhaps?

  

**Get 200 people to pay $416/month for 12 months.**

\- Nothing in this range for me, but this could be something for a high end living room sofa, or top of the line TV or audio set. Furniture-as-a-service? Haha.

  

**Get 500 people to pay $166/month for 12 months.**

\- power and utilities go here. Basic infrastructural stuff. Also the instalments price range for electronics like laptops, mobile phones.  

  

**Get 1000 people to pay $83/month for 12 months.**

\- lots of my monthly subscriptions fall into this range. Cable TV and home broadband and public transport costs fall into this range. I think this is the price range many are comfortable to pay for family and team subscriptions perhaps. Basecamp, a team project management SaaS, is $99. But depends on what service/content of course...  

  

**Get 5000 people to pay $16/month for 12 months.**

\- My mobile phone plan is slightly higher, but there's increasing competition locally, so prices are dropping. This is the price range for more premium personal apps perhaps? Superhuman, a premium email service, is $30 per month. 

  

**Get 10,000 people to pay $8.33/month for 12 months.**

\- a lot of entertainment sites are priced around this, e.g. Netflix, Viu. I think this is the sweet spot for many SaaS apps for personal/consumer level use, e.g. productivity apps, to-do apps, simple web hosting, domain hosting, music apps. Kanban Mail, an email app from an indie maker, is $8 per month.

  

**Get 100,000 people to pay $0.83/month for 12 months.**

\- I'd seen digital newspapers going for this price. But rare to see anything priced at this range. It might work as sort of a percentage cut from a middleman service, like transactional fee for someone using your payment system? In the developing world, this might be considerably high enough for a substantial service.

  

It's an interesting exercise for sure. I often think about SaaS apps only in 1 or 2 price ranges ($83 and $16), but perhaps there's SaaS products that can target the markets in the other prices too. Good food for thought.
