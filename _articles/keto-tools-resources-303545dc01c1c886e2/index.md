Two months into the keto diet right now. @knight asked me about the tools and resources I use for keto, so here goes:

  

**Cronometer**

I use [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) app for calculating macros and finding out nutritional info. If I can't find macros info of something on Google, I use Cronometer. Downside is that much of the foods listed are US-centric, and many Asian ingredients are not listed. Wish there's an Asian version!

  

**Local Facebook communities**

By far the most useful thing on my keto journey so far had been joining local keto Facebook groups! My favourite group is [Singapore Keto Lifestyle For The Busy](https://www.facebook.com/groups/410009192752707/) - they chat a lot, and everyone's really friendly and supportive. I get to learn from the experts who had been doing it for years, in the same context/location as I am. Everyday, there's new recipes and products shared. Interestig hacks when eating out. Inspiring stories of people overcoming diabetes, weight issues. Best of all, people asking questions about how to do keto, and learning from all the answers. I learned about the importance of electrolytes, carnivore diets, the myth of fibre, and so much more. There's a lot of information available out on the internet, but experiential wisdom is harder to find. These groups help with that.

  

**Keto groups on Reddit**

[r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) is a great resource. Just the FAQs alone is a treasure trove of knowledge. It's also a great portal to global keto community. I really love [r/ketoscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/) because that's where people discuss actual research and studies, and keeps me on my toes and not just accept whatever on blind faith.

  

**Keto List Singapore**

Of course, how can I not mention my own product [Keto List Singapore](https://table2site.com/site/ketolistsingapore)? ? But bias aside, it does help me out, especially when I'm looking for places to eat when I'm out, or when I'm craving for keto bakes/snacks.

  

_What are some tools that you use for keto? @keni, @knight, @brandonwilson ?_
