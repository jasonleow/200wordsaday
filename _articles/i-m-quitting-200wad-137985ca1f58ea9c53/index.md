After 115 days, it had finally come to this. I'm quitting writing 200 words a day.

  

I'm done. I'd written everything I wanted to write. It doesn't feel like there's anything left to be juiced out. I started out writing because I had a lot of backlog of stuff to write, but even so, just writing for the sake of downloading it out into the world feels boring. Along the way, I started an ebook and didn't complete it. I wrote loads of stuff about travel. After all had been written and I went into a slump, I even tried writing sh\*t up, like using emojis as a topic, and finding random words in the real world and piecing them together into a post. 

  

But I was just cheating myself. 

  

Simple fact is, I'd lost interest, and the only reason I hung around was because I couldn't let go of the streak. How powerful, this one little motivation tool. Just the imagined pain of breaking a row of crosses on a calendar can make me single-mindedly commit to something every single day, for so many days. In fact, it's almost 4 months now. 

  

What's next, you might ask? Rest for weary, perhaps? 

  

I don't know. 

  

Or maybe I'll go try that 750 words a day platform... 

  

  

  

  

  

  

Hahaha ?
