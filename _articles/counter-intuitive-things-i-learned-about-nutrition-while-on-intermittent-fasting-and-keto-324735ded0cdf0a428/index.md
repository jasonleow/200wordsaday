Counter-intuitive things I learned about nutrition and wellness while on intermittent fasting and keto diet, based on personal experience and all the reading up I had to do:

  

**Fat is not always evil** 

Good quality fats from fresh produce like avocados, wild salmon, butter from grass-fed cows are actually good for you. Essential, in fact, for a healthy diet. Of course, in moderation. But universal rejection of fats because "fats are unhealthy" will ironically make us unhealthier. 

  

**Asians need to eat rice**

Maybe it was a good fuel source back then when we were agrarian societies and worked hard physically. But with our sedentary urban lives right now, that old cultural norm deserves a serious relook. Or at least we don't need to eat as much as we do. Besides, the white rice grain had arguably become mostly empty calories, with over-farming practices and food system deterioration.

  

**Breakfast is NOT the most important meal of the day**

There isn't any most important meal. It's about healthy intake of macro and micro-nutrients through the day/month/years, eating in moderation and at the right time. Barring any existing health issues (say, gastric pains), it's perfectly okay to skip breakfast.

  

**Eating all the time is actually not all good**

There's a food myth that instead of eating 3 big meals a day, it's better to eat smaller meals. Making your body digest food all day everyday is actually not ALL good. It's good to starve the body from time to time during the day, or for periods of time during the year. Fasting had been a cultural tradition found all over the world, and it's not just for cultural but health reasons.

  

**Eat fat to lose fat**

On a keto diet, probably the first most counterintuitive thing one encounters is having to eat fat as a main source of energy. Yes, about 75% of your calories comes from fat. The funny thing is most people do this to lose weight (and fat). How? Long story short, avoiding carbs and eating (not too much) fats forces the body to switch to fat burning metabolically. 

  

**You can have the sweet without the sugar**

Yes. That realisation probably saved my diet from myself. Truth is, I have a sweet tooth. I loved my desserts, ice cream, and cakes. Even on keto now, I still do. So imagine my horror of having to wean off my sweets. I mean, what kind of quality of life is that if I can't ever have a dessert ever again? (LOL) But the ill effects of sugar is also one of the main reasons why I'm doing this diet - I can see and feel what it's doing to my body, and I'm getting worried. It was a huge internal conflict. Salvation came when I learned about alternative keto-friendly sweeteners that are actually natural, with no harmful side effects, and doesn't raise insulin levels (unlike those artificial ones like aspartame). Monk fruit sweetener is actually one of those things that's actually way sweeter than cane sugar, but without any of the ills. That was mind-blowing, because I always associated sweetness with sugar. No sweet without sugar, I thought. And when sugar being the bad guy, so did anything sweet. But yessss, now there can be sweetness without sugar. If natural sweeteners are safe, do I really have to demonise sweetness? Even if I stop the keto diet in a possible future, I doubt I would want to or need to touch sugar again because there's these much healthier and just as sweet alternatives.

  

**A doughnut becomes a 10x doughnut while you're fasting**  

Coming out from a fast, it's important to be careful what you put into you, because after a 16h fast, the body is very insulin sensitive and if you start taking your usual carbs in huge amounts, it sky-rockets your insulin compared to if you didn't fast. So a doughnut that didn't faze you without fasting could be a lot more potent while you are. Not done correctly, people can actually gain weight while doing intermittent fasting. I like to think of fasting as an amplifier - it amplifies both the goods and the bads that you eat, with outsized downstream effects. So we have to choose ever wiser while on it. What a keystone habit, that ensures a cascading effect of healthier food choices and mindful eating.

  

**Fibre is not always good for digestion and constipation**

The mainstream view is that fibre is good for you. Especially if you're constipated. But I recently saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdvC0mM3oUA) where a doctor talked about a study, and his own experience helping his patients, that fibre might actually worsen constipation. He likened it to adding cars to the road to stop a traffic jam. The research he quoted showed how constipated folks on a zero fibre diet did way better than those on a high fibre one. More bowel movement. Less bloating. Mind-blown. Truth is, I had fibre anxiety after starting on keto. Because I had to swear off fruit while on keto, and even had to be careful around vegetables due to intrinsic carbs, I worried if I was getting enough fibre for my gut health. But this study made me re-examine everything I believed about fibre. I'm going to experiment more in this and see how my body responds to it.

  

**Salt is your best friend**

Salt had always been associated with hypertension/high blood pressure. Even our health authorities get food vendors to display choices for less salt. So avoiding salty foods had always been my practice. But going keto brought about electrolyte loss, namely, sodium, potassium and magnesium. How this happens is most of these minerals are stored in the water as part of glycogen in our body, which drains away when you go on keto, thus leading to electrolyte lack, and muscle weakness, cramps, low energy etc. I find myself having to drink salt water and take more salty foods just to make up the 2000mg daily recommended intake.   

  

**Plants are not always your best friends**

Eat your greens, they say. I was vegan before and know about the health benefits of a plant-based diet. The mainstream narrative is such that it feels like you can do no wrong with eating greens, ever. But what I didn't know before was how there's also many anti-nutrients and toxins from eating plants too. Lectins, phytates and oxolates are just some toxins found in grains, beans, nuts, soy, tofu, seeds, spinach. All the stuff that's supposed to be good for us, that's supposed to do no wrong. Thing is, before Big Agri and the widespread availability of such plant foods, our bodies can manage to detoxify these plant toxins as we didn't eat so much of them. But not so now. So eat your plants but watch out for these unwholesome phytochemicals.

  

**Eat when hungry, don't eat for the sake of eating**

3 meals a day had become such a norm that it's hard to imagine otherwise. But since on keto and intermittent fasting, I'd learned to listen to the body, that the body is the boss. Some days I'm starving before a meal and I eat more. Double portions, even. Some days, I don't feel hungry and I (try to) eat less. I say "try to", because it's so ingrained in our social practices that we have to eat when it's time, whether our body says it is hungry or not. Otherwise risk developing gastric pains, they say. I say now, don't eat for the sake of eating. Eat when hungry. Stop when you feel full - you don't have to clean up your plate, your body is not a rubbish dump to throw uneaten food in. And don't eat when you don't feel like it. Most importantly, listen to your body. Listen.

  

**Red meat causes heart problems...NOT** _**always**_

That's the fascinating thing about being on keto. It's a diet that flips our traditional diet narratives on its head. But this insight applies if and only if you are on the keto diet. Because red meat can be bad for you, if you are on a high carb diet. But that doesn't quite apply, if you're on a low carb or keto diet. I used to avoid eating red meat for those reasons, sticking to mostly chicken. But now, beef is a frequent food. It seems to fill me up a lot more than white meats. It also has more of the mineral nutrients I need. More and more restaurants seems to be offering healthier versions of organic, grass-fed beef, so that's a plus!

  

**You CAN reverse Type 2 diabetes**

I'm amazed by the daily pipeline of personal stories I read on reddit, Facebook communities of how people managed to reverse their Type 2 diabetes through keto. It's just crazy! The most optimistic cases I heard of in the past was a lifetime of medication, and minor to major complications. But the running log of people reversing diabetes with keto is just too frequent and common to brush it off as one-offs. Unfortunately, most doctors aren't quite open to how effective preventive methods like keto might work better than remedial methods using medication and surgery. ?‍♂️  

  

**Low carb diets isn't a fad, it's actually been around since as early as 1860s!**

Unlike many fad diets, low carb diets had been practised under the guise of various names for decades. The very first mention had been in 1860, by [William Banting](https://www.businessinsider.com/keto-diet-william-banting-discovery-origin-1862-2019-1)! Before keto, similar versions of low carb diets had these names: Atkins, Eco-Atkins, Paleo, South Beach, Dukan, Scandinavian Low Carb, Bulletproof, Slow Carb. Any sound familiar? 

  

**Listening to the body over any keto diet principles**

I like this contrarian insight the most. You often hear long term keto practitioners advise people to listen to their bodies, against some commonly held truth about the keto diet. One example is how you should just eat a moderate amount of protein, while on keto. But some keto folks actually transition on to eating full carnivore, because it could be that the usual keto fats don't go down so well for them, or that the low carbs still trigger their conditions (like GERD). They listened to their bodies and it works for them, keto rules be damned. 

  

**Food labels can't be trusted (even if they pass regulatory rules)**

I dare say 99% of food manufacturers are out to mislead you when it comes to the food label. There are legal and legally grey ways of doing so. It's like the nutritional version of dark UX patterns (ever tried buying a budget airline ticket?). The remaining 1% are usually those small-scale, ethical, indie food producers who are often part of the community they sell to, like keto folks selling to other keto folks. Since on keto, I obsessively check the food macros and ingredients list for every product I pick up at the supermarket. Some of the most misleading ones are chocolates that's proudly "sugar-free", but contain maltitol or dextrose (which will increase your blood sugar anyhow). Or they try to go vague with ingredient names like "Natural flavours", hoping you won't realise. Otherwise they try to do a mathematical sleight of hand with you: "Oh, 5g carbs per serving, that's great! Then discover: "Per serving = 1 teaspoon or some ridiculously small amount that's impossible to not eat many times over with that kind of food product." Low carb ice cream tend to like using this tactic. And some products just outright lie with a straight face. Ever saw "Low GI (glycemic index) sugar?" LOL.  

  

**Sugar is not evil. Yes, WHITE CANE SUGAR type of sugar.**

OK this is when some purist/strict keto practitioner will kick me out of whatever group I'm in for saying this. But I will say what's backed by science, not what's people prefer to believe. The science shows that too much carbs (therefore sugar) is bad for health. It doesn't say that any sort of tiny amount of sugar is bad. Sugar is not poison! It's not like cynanide. Sugar is not poison, I say again. It only gets 'poisonous' when you eat too much of it. It's our eating habits, the abundance of ultra-processed sugars around us, that's killing us. In and of itself, sugar isn't evil. But here's the difficult thing - things aren't so black and white in keto, unlike in other sorts of diets. One does need to take nuance into account. It's contextual and situational. 

  

What's a big no-no for someone who's diabetic might be okay for someone healthy and on maintenance keto. Everyone's health profile is different, and their health goals differ too. For those on maintenance keto, sugar in small amounts, within limits, and occasionally, is okay. But if one still has sweet cravings despite on maintenance keto, perhaps avoidance for a bit more time is good practice, in case it triggers carb relapse. For those who are overweight and/or just starting keto, being more strict is better. Or for those who have more serious health conditions, avoiding altogether for rest of their lives might be good for them. The confusing thing for anyone starting out is that you hear advice from people who's doing keto in a certain way based on their health profile, and it might not be similar to yours. So being discerning is important. Get your facts straight from research, and hear from more than one person. Ask them about their profile to get some context.
