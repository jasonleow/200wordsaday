Some plans for September - "_Singular September_", because there's a recurring theme of the number **ONE**. Also denotes **singular focus** on just getting stuff out the gate and into the world.

  

### **Launch 1 product**

*   Just-in-time learning of Rails, no need to boil the ocean, just what I need to make and launchÂ 
*   It will have to be a minimum viable product for sure, but fully working and functional for that minimum set of feature(s), solving 1 painpoint for an ultra-niche group of users.
*   Out of a total of 4 product ideas which I will launch and iterate on (will share more about this later)

  

### **Get 1 customer**

*   Yes, just one. This is the equivalent of writing 200 words a day, doing 1 rep at the gym, the 2-min rule of downscaling your habits to make it easy to stick to. Yes, getting paid customers should be a habit for any serious entrepreneur, otherwise it's just a hobby!
*   Not sure if I can count as one customer. That might be cheating?

  

### **1% weekly improvement for keystone habit system**

*   1% compounding effects per day leads to [3700% growth](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-power-of-1-growth-236975d3d99ca22c78) in a year, 1% per week leads to 170% growth in a year - I might not be able to improve 1% everyday, but I can try find 1% increments every week at least!
*   Interesting questions to think about - what does 1% improvement in fitness, diet, sleep, meditation, deloading/review, deep work look like? How can I measure or at least guesstimate it meaningfully?
*   Keep repeating this mantra which I learned from my [harshest teacher](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-body-is-my-harshest-teacher-258615d63cfe16a92b) (which I'm beginning to realise it can extend far beyond just the body and physical health): "I surrender to the wisdom that is my body. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender."

  

### **Books to finish or check out**
