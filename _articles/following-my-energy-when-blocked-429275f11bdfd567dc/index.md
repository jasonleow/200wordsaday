These days it's hard to stay motivated and focused. After all, it's still [Jiā Yóu July](https://cowriters.app/words/ji-yu-july-423235efddbf52b078) for me. Still trying to pick up bits and pieces of myself in the aftermath of a crisis. I tried learning new things like Vue, which helps. Learning new things always helps. I found myself being quite easily distracted and unable to focus on the important tasks at hand, and just falling into doing whatever I felt like doing.

  

Whatever that I enjoyed doing in that moment. Like, for example:

  

**Learning**

Learning Vue and Nuxt - the freshness and excitement of learning new stuff and applying them to create stuff, always helps me get out of a funk.

  

**Designing**

Designing graphics and posters - I often have to do some graphic design for my work for VisualAid and other products. That sense of accomplishment and creation never fails to make me feel better, every time I see the end result after a deep session of moving pixels around.

  

**Reading**

Reading posts, articles of other interesting and successful things that other Indie Hackers are doing - living vicariously through others, drawing inspiration from the hard work of others, had always helped me through dark times too.

  

**Hanging out with my son**

There's something refreshing about being with a baby. I could be frustrated about some work thing, and it all but disappears when I get up, walk over to my room, and interact with him together with my wife. As much as I give to him, he gives back to me too.

  

I think whenever I felt like I needed to follow my energy, it always worked. Doing the rational thing to get unblocked often fails harder, for me. The only challenge now that's different from the past is the fear of not earning enough money, blocking me from truly following my energy. But just as I'm writing this and thinking this thought, I catch myself. Of course! Maybe that's exactly what I need to do now, what I needed to have let go of for some time already. Letting go of that money worry, and just following my energy to do whatever works in the moment.

  

Eventually, that tiny stream of energy will join other streams, and lead to larger rivers, and ultimately freed into the ocean.

  

Just follow that stream.
