When was the last time you did something for the first time? "My draft" as a post title is probably the best indicator here in 200wad that this is your very first post. Everyday I read the many "My draft" posts on the main feed, and I always wonder - what made you sign up for this? What's that feeling like to want to try something new for the first time? It's been 80 days running here for me. Just a short 2.5 months, but felt so long since that very first fateful post. I don't remember how writing and posting that first post felt like anymore. I just remember I was in Bali on a personal retreat. I was nomading. I had lots of new experiences and I had loads to share and write about. I felt free. I felt alive. That was probably the last time I did something for the first time. And now, after 80 days, as things start to feel 'normal', how do you continue to write as if it's your first "My draft"? How does one write everyday with the freshness of an eager beginner; the curiosity of a bright-eyed baby; the excitement of a teenage first kiss?
