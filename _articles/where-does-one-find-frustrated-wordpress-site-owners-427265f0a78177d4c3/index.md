I'm experimenting with a pivot for my JAMstack web design and build productized serviced called [Sweet Jam Sites](https://sweetjamsites.com). Maybe instead of trying to offer a website with free hosting, I can leverage on the benefits of JAMstack—the speed and security—to Wordpress site owners who are frustrated with having to deal with a seemingly endless and futile, Sisyphean cycles of security updates and software bloat.

  

But where does one find frustrated customers of any product or service, for that matter? What are some smart ways to find out where they hang out? Knowing where to find them is the first step to establishing a scalable way to find leads. It's easy to find customers of a product or service, but frustrated ones? Yes frustrated customers probably hang out in the same Facebook groups or communities as happy customers, but it's likely to be in poor taste to be promoting an anti-Wordpress service to a community who's there to use Wordpress, isn't it? 

  

Going into a competitor's forum to share is likely not work well too, like say Webflow. If they are already in Webflow, they had made the switch already. What I want to do is to catch them before they switch.

  

Talking to people on Facebook and Twitter, here's some possible solutions:

  

*   Scan through reviews of Wordpress on e.g. the forum page [Requests and Feedback Fourm](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/requests-and-feedback/), find reviews that speak of that frustration. Key words being "slow", "not secure", "got hacked!".
*   Content marketing: create content that targets similar key words to help people ready to switch from Wordpress to something else. Help them compare Wordpress and JAMstack side by side.
*   'Gig' marketing: Offer Wordpress-to-JAMstack gigs on Fiverr, Upwork
*   Entrepreneur type of communities: For people just starting up and looking to create their own website, participate in those communities and offer advice and provide value to help them decide which web builders are suitable for them. If they want something faster and safer, provide JAMstack as a suggestion.
