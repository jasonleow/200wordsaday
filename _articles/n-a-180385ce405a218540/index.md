Blank slate. Empty. Nothing. Zero. White space. 

  

How lovely, a blank slate. Just white space. Unsullied. Pristine. Pure. Crystalline. Clear. All available for me to write anything on. 200 words, long or short, fast or slow, onto this beautiful blank slate.

  

On some days, it's hard to fill up this blank slate with 200 words. A slump day. On other days, 2000 words whiz past and you're still not stopping. A peak day. And the key difference? What you experienced during the day, or week, or month.

  

Because we are what eat. And I mean not just food that we put into our mouths, but the food that we put into our minds. Experiences, feelings, sensations, thoughts, thoughts about thoughts. Scenes, photos, videos, words, people, landscapes, interactions, relationships. All these we stuff ourselves with everyday. And our mind has a much bigger appetite than our stomachs, I must say. 

  

And what we eat with our minds, show up on this blank slate. Ever ate heavily processed, nutrient-low junk food loaded with sugar, oil and chemicals? That feeling of heaviness, that food coma that lingers. If we ate junk food for our minds, our efforts here will resemble the physical counterpart - sluggish, sleepy, slow. Uninspired to write. But if we ate the equivalent of high quality, organic, freshly grown, lightly-cooked, clean food in well balanced portions and proportions, we feel light, energized, and a sense of well-being as we write. Our writings will radiate light, energy and well-being. 

  

Our writings don't lie. It shows. It's the lie detector of your mind, your soul. What occupies you in the day, shows up in your writing, subtly.  

  

I'm looking for the vegetarian version of a mind's diet. How does that look like? No social media? More nature? Less gossip and small talk, more deep connection? More movement, less sitting? Hanging out with people who inspired you?

  

What will it take?
