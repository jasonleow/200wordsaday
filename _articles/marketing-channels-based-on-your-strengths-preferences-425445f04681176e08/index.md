Building on what [@keenencharles posted](https://cowriters.app/words/marketing-yourself-425275f03f4bc30d19):

  

For products, I've had more success focusing on marketing channels that fit my interests. SEO, email, and social media aren't as dependent on personal networks so it's felt more natural to me to pursue those. For myself, can the equivalent work? What are the marketing channels that suit my personality? Instead of forcing myself to do things I have zero interest in like writing tutorials I can find ways that work for me.

  

I really like that idea he put out. That there might be some marketing channels that suit me more than others. I kind of always seen marketing as this whole block of activities that I generally not enjoyed doing. But reading his post made me think. Perhaps, just like how SEO, email and social media felt more natural for him to pursue as they aren't dependent on personal networks, what might be the marketing channels that would leverage on and fit my interests, strengths, personality?

  

Out of say, [51 marketing channels](https://blogs.spectrio.com/51-most-effective-marketing-channels-for-advertising-your-business) listed in this article, what might be great for me? First, let's list them out:

  

**? Internet marketing -** website, SEO, retargeting (ads), newsletter, live chat, podcast, whitepapers, webinars, blogging, guest blogging, search engine marketing (PPC ads), chat bots, AR/VR

**? Social media channels -** Facebook page, Facebook group, Facebook ads, LinkedIn page, Google business profile, Youtube channel, Yelp profile, custom graphics/content, Twitter, Instagram, livestreaming, influencers 

**? Physical marketing -** exterior signage, digital signage, interactive signs, customer loyalty rewards, giveaways, promotions, brochures, packaging, overhead messages, free consultations, on-hold messaging

**? Paid advertising -** podcast ads, affiliate marketing, Nextdoor (what's this??), billboards, mailers, print ads, radio ads, social media ads, TV ads

**? Public relations -** press releases, media interviews, sponsorships, speaking events, conferences, self-hosted events

  

So coming back to the question, which channels are great for me? For someone who:

*   a solo indie hacker without a PR team nor huge budget
*   doesn't have a huge network online and offline
*   no screen personality, disinterested in media glare, prefers to stay out of limelight or being on stage in real life or digital (like influencers) 
*   makes digital products and prefers the scalability of digital marketing
*   prefers things done remotely instead of face-to-face
*   can write content but finds it time-consuming and prefers building

  

So looking at my preferences and assets, the best marketing channels seems to be:

  

**? Internet marketing -** website, SEO, retargeting (ads), newsletter, live chat, (ghost/irregular) blogging, guest blogging, search engine marketing (PPC ads), chat bots

**? Social media channels -** Facebook page, Facebook group, Facebook ads, LinkedIn page, Google business profile, custom graphics/content, Twitter

**? Physical marketing -** customer loyalty rewards, giveaways, promotions (all digital, without a high budget)

**? Paid advertising -** affiliate marketing, social media ads

**? Public relations -** maybe an occasional public speaking event or conference, but only very very rarely, and something that I'm dying to share

  

It's interesting to see how the recurring themes on my preferred marketing channels seems to be more software-based, automated, scalable via other platforms, and network effects from customers. Great! Time to experiment!
