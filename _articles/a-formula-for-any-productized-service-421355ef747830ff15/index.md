Here's a formula to use when you're thinking of starting a productized service:

  

**"Done-for-you" / "Unlimited" / "24/7"**

**\+ <platform of your preference>** 

**\+ <task>** 

**\+ "for $<cost>/month"**

**\= your productized service** 

  

**"Done-for-you"** means just what it means. Best contrasted with DIY "do-it-yourself" which happens often in SaaS. Sometimes customers don't want to learn how to use the new SaaS. They just want someone to do it for them. That's "done-for-you." A variation of "done-for-you" is "done-with-you", where there's some involvement on the part of the client.

  

**"Unlimited"** or **"24/7"** in the context of productized services usually means there's no limits to the number of tasks you can commission per week/month, but usually there's a queue mechanism where you can only ask for one task at a time (or a few tasks for more premium packages).

  

Next for **<platform of you preference>**, think about which (software) platform you are skilled in, passionate about or have already at least a few customers in. It could be Wordpress, Shopify, or something not related to software, like the travel industry. What's one common **<task>** that your existing customers frequently would pay for?  How much would they pay for, and how much make business sense for you? That goes into the **"for $<cost>/month"**.

  

Example: I have 3 productized services I'm running now – Outsprint Design, Sweet Jam Sites and UX Storyboard:

  

[Outsprint](https://outsprint.io): "Done-with-you + public sector + design sprints + at $30k per sprint."

[Sweet Jam Sites](https://sweetjamsites.com): "Done-for-you + JAMstack + websites + from $99 per site."

[UX Storyboard](https://uxstoryboard.com/): "Done-for-you + storyboards + to visualise your product UX + from $99." 

  

Other notable productized services like WP Buffs, Scott Cheap Flights:

  

WP Buffs: "24/7 + Wordpress + maintenance + from $56/month." 

Scott Cheap Flights: "Get notified + about cheap flight deals + via email + at $49/year."
