How does a good home-body life look like? How might staying home all the time be fulfilling, fun and healthy?

  

I'd never been much of a home-body, to be honest. I like getting out and about, seeing new things, checking out new places. Even if back home, I like to be a traveler in my own country. I love novelty. It makes life comes alive. I think a 80:20 mix of being out and being home works well for me. I'm a nomad at heart.

  

Being home is challenging for me. The days blend into one another. I just work everyday, or I don't. Almost feels like there's no day or night, weekday or weekend. My brain turns into mush from having too little stimulation and variation within the same four walls, all of the day, all of the time. 

  

So you can see that I'd never had the experience nor developed the skill to be a home-body. How do I make staying home more wholesome, satisfying, entertaining, and healthy? 

  

Some thoughts and ideas:

  

*   Have weekday-weekend schedules even while at home. Or at least designated rest days and work days.
*   Schedule entertainment hours, fitness hours, work hours, meal hours, even if kids at home means you have to multi-task or do clustered work.
*   Segregate space for different tasks that needs a different mind space. Just like you don't eat in the toilet. Work and entertainment being the easiest to think about. 
*   Change clothes to suit the task. Or even a small accessory will do the trick. A friend wears a ring (that she wears when she leaves home for work) when working, and takes it off when she's done working.
*   Try out [hygge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge) - "a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment." Imagine Scandinavian-inspired rooms like the ones you see in an IKEA catalogue. I can live in that for ages!
*   Have things to look forward to. Parties, celebrations, picnics on the balcony. 

  

_Anything else? Besides the daily living activities, how about other bigger life goals and aspirations? How does one create a space for that?_
