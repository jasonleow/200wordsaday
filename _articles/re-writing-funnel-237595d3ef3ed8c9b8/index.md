@basilesamel shared a good idea about curating and funnelling 200wad posts onto his personal blog and Twitter account. I'd been thinking the same too, but never once thought about how Twitter can be part of it, nor ever thought of framing it all as a funnel. So thanks, Baz! 

  

As I dive into a new season of indie making and making a living off it, I recognise that marketing my work and myself is something I am usually weak at. I can definitely do more and do better in this. Setting up a writing funnel might help. Being more intentional about how I share my content around the internet feels like something I can benefit from, even though I have no tangible idea right now how it can be so. Perhaps I can just do it first and figure out later? 

  

So, for a start, my writing funnel can be (from content creation to consumption, to commenting, discussion and sharing): 

  

*   200wad for atomic writing and writing-to-think.
*   Personal blog of long form content.
*   Canonical cross-posting to Medium for commenting.
*   Twitter for debate and shouting matches.
*   Facebook/LinkedIn for showing off to people I know.
*   Telegram, IH, Slack for ad-hoc sharing to niche groups. 

  

For those who had done this before, what might be some things I should be aware or cautious about when doing this funnel?
