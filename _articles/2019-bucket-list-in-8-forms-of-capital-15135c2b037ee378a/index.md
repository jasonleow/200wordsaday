Every year for 3 years now, I'll set targets that I wish to achieve for the year, using a holistic framework called **8 forms of capital**.   

  

We usually understand capital as financial capital, i.e. money. This framework was created by [Ethan Roland & Gregory Landua](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/8-forms-of-capital/) as a way to broaden our economic understanding of capital beyond money, using permaculture principles. They asked:

  

> “What would it look like if we re-designed the global financial system using permaculture principles?” What if our financial system looked more like an ecosystem?” 

  

The 8 forms of capital are:  

? **Financial capital:** money, financial instruments, investments

⚒️ **Material capital:** materials, natural resources, tools buildings, infrastructure

? **Living capital:** nature, land, ecosystems, animals, health (my own addition)

? **Intellectual capital:** ideas, knowledge, words, images, intellectual property

? **Experiential capital:** action, embodied experienced, worldly wisdom  

? **Social capital:** connections, relationships, influence

? **Cultural capital:** song, story, ritual, art, theatre, community customs

⛩️ **Spiritual capital:** prayer, faith, beliefs, spiritual attainment

  

I love how the framework made me think about capital beyond simply money. You have capital (in the form of social capital) if you have friends who can help you organise your wedding, for example, instead of paying money (financial capital) for an event organiser to do it. So different forms of capital can transform/replace financial capital, and vice versa. Typically this framework was used to talk about a more holistic perspective of financial and economic systems, but I adapted this for personal, lifestyle design purposes, which I think still works! After all, aren't we all agents and actors embodying these forms of capital within our economic systems? And it helps me think and plan holistically, so that I don't over-emphasize one aspect of life over another. Seeing capital in 8 forms also puts money in its rightful place and priority, as an enabler for the other forms of capital that contributes to happiness and well-being; as a means to an end instead of an end in itself. It probably feels like over-planning for some who prefer to freestyle their way through life, but for me at least, the important part here less about the hard specifics and more about setting intentions. The specifics can evolve or iterate as the year progresses. The list then becomes the basis of my review at the end of the year - yes it can be used for holistically reviewing what you done too.
