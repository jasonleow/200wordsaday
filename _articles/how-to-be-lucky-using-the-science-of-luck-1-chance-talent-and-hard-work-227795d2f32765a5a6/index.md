I just read [How Luck Happens: Using the Science of Luck to Transform Work, Love, and Life](https://www.amazon.com/How-Luck-Happens-Science-Transform-ebook/dp/B073R28Y81), by Janice Kaplan and Barnaby Marsh. It's a really awesome book into why some people are more lucky than others, and how we can leverage on things we can do in order to be luckier. In other words, luck is (party) a SKILL that you can hone. The science of luck will be an interesting trend to watch, much like how the concept of antifragile trends, because both have their roots in complexity, systems-thinking, and chaos.  

  

Sharing them here as reference for myself, and for anyone who might find it useful. This is not a book review, just raw notes lifted directly from the book, with some minor interpretations and categorisations of my own. This is part of my [reading list for a new season](https://200wordsaday.com/words/reading-list-for-a-new-season-220315d233ada32ec9).  

  

**Overview**

"Luck is when preparation meets opportunity" 

Luck occurs at the intersection of chance, talent and hard work.

Luck isn’t a zero sum game - plenty for everyone if you know where and how to look for it.

Most importantly is: you can make your own luck. It’s not completely random. It’s not completely about forces beyond your control.

More risk doesn’t mean more luck. Luck is asymmetrical - some good luck if it works, but lots of bad luck if it doesn't. Or vice versa. The heroic path isn’t the only way to luck.

  

**Proactive**

Luck is not passive - it requires action.

Every action you take changes the odds, so the original statistic might not be accurate to your context.

Hard work = persistence, focus, attentiveness to possibility. Face lots of failures and keep trying before getting lucky.

Liking the challenge and having fun helps you stay in it longer, and luckier.

How you respond to opportunity matters too.

  

**Attentiveness**

Be attentive to opportunities, be prepared for anything, and try the unexpected. 

Having information, knowing when and where to look helps you be more lucky.

Attentiveness to opportunity = flexible attention, able to switch between narrow and open focus fast, to subtle signals - seldom are they loud and in your face.

Curiosity helps.
