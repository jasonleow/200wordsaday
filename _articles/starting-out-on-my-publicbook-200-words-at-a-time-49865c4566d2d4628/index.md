_As an experiment, I'm writing my ebook in public, on 200wad. Write it with me, watch me try, see me falter._   

  

What's [#publicbook](https://200wordsaday.com/search?category=publicbook)? It's a thing started by [@basilesamel](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/basilesamel), where "we write books in public on 200wad." He described it very well [here](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-am-writing-a-book-in-public-5585c109c5735a98). I was really intrigued by the concept when I first saw it! Writing a book feels too hard, even a short one. It's not just the length - but the whole perception around how hard it is to write a book in general - the effort (years!), the editing (countless rounds back and forth with the editor), the quality and skill in writing  you need to have before even attempting. You read stories about how good writers write their novels and you think there's no way you can be like them, ever. 

  

But writing some your thoughts on a topic, 200 words at a time? That sounds doable! Already, I'm 46 days in on writing 200 words everyday, with a word count of 23,431 - equivalent to about 93 pages of a book! Having analytics like these is pretty encouraging.  

  

I'd been mulling and procrastinating about writing the ebook for weeks now, to the point it's paralysis by analysis. Screw it, I'm just gonna start anyway, and figure things out along the way. It's just 200 words at a time anyway. If I don't like what I see after a few tries, I can tweak it, course-correct, or abandon ship. Either way, not much loss.  

  

_Next: what's the ebook about?_
