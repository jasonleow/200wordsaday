_Day 14 of the #200wad challenge._

  

I was inspired to write about the mirror as a law of the universe after reading this tweet about [@refinedmindset](https://twitter.com/refinedmindset/status/1074338362717364224):

  

> One of the greatest laws I've come to know is the mirror:  
> \-How others treat you is a reflection of how you treat others  
> \-Your bank account is a reflection of your work ethic  
> \-Your body reflects your diet  
> \-etc  
> If you want change, face yourself in the mirror. nothing else will bring it.

  

  

His tweet really resonated, especially the part about the mirror as a law of the universe. 

  

While some are almost plain, silly obvious (e.g. your body reflects your diet), there's some mirrors in life that's non-obvious but once you see it, it's so true you cannot unsee it.

 - The feedback you give to someone is more of a reflection of who you are and what you value than a reflection of the person you are giving feedback to.  

 - Your actions reflect what your true intentions and priorities are more than your words. This is commonly known as "Talk is cheap/Actions speak louder than words." If you say you will/want to do something but don't, your actions just mirrored your true priorities. If someone said they care for you but didn't, then they don't really mean that. It's surprising how plain silly and well-known this is but people continually fall for it. Case in point: politicians, abusive relationships.  

 - How you treat the janitor/receptionist is a more accurate reflection of you than how you treat your peers/bosses. 

 - The manner in which your friend speaks of someone else when not in his/her presence is a reflection of how your friend will speak of you when you are not around.

 - How you feel about your choice between 2 options after choosing it reflects your true preference.  

 - Read a Zen quote before that went something like this: "If you want to know your past, look at your body. If you want to know your future, look at your mind." Your body bears the scars of what you did to yourself in the past, while what you think everyday now will manifest in your actions and your future.  

  

So what other non-obvious laws of the mirror do you know about?
