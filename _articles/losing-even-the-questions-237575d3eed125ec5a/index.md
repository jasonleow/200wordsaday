I saw this quote on my social media feeds. Made me sit up:

  

> In Zen, we don't find the answers. We lose the questions.

  

What a beautiful way to describe Zen practice. I'm guessing that's the intended outcome of Zen [koans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) too. Ever heard of the famous Zen koan "What's the sound of one hand clapping?" It's a question that perhaps we are meant to lose, because trying to find the answer is the process, not the outcome.

  

I had always loved collecting questions. I believe that asking a beautiful question is more important for our self growth than finding the right answer. Because an answer is fixed in a specific space and time when the learning moment occured, and gets outdated immediately upon conception. A question, however, is a springboard for better answers, which quickly evolves into more beautiful questions upon contact with reality. I was under the impression that self growth is just finding question after question, and one's spiritual journey involves diving ever deeper from one inquiry to another... But it seems, I am mistaken. 

  

Ultimately, you lose even the questions. 

  

It's mind-blowing and mind-boggling. In a space where there are no answers to latch on to, and no questions to guide the path, how does one abide? 

  

Or perhaps, just perhaps, this is my koan?
