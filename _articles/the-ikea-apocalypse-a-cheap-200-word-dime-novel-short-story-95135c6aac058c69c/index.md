It was just a normal Sunday. I went to IKEA because I craved meatballs. But just as I stepped into IKEA, a frail-looking elderly lady tugged on my hand. She looked strange, dressed in black from head to toe. I thought I smelled ash on her. 

  

"Will you help me get the things I need today? This place is so confusing, and I'm alone today...... Let me buy you meatballs after we're done?" 

  

What can I say to a frail old lady? At least I get free meatballs. So off I went with her, list in hand, her arm in the other. Slowly, we ticked things off her list. It was a hefty list! All 666 items.  

  

Finally, after a couple of hours, we tossed the last item into the trolley. 

  

"Are you sure we got all of them? Let's check each item in the trolley with the list, one by one?"

  

Sigh. "Sure......"

  

_**"Billy. Solglimtar. Gratulera. Ivar. Lisabo. Mörbylånga......."**_ 

  

When I was done reciting the 666th item, the skies grew dark.  

  

"Thank you for summoning the Great Old One," she bellowed. "Only you could have done it. Muah hahaha hahahha!"
