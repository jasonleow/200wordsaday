Chanced on this today via @nepentheez on my social feeds:

  

> _"Don't be so hard on yourself for feeling lost, confused or like you haven't achieved all that you wanted to achieve. Life would be pretty damn boring if you'd done it all already, if you had no more room to grow or things to learn. Be patient. You'll eventually figure it all out and everything will make perfect sense. Every experience will get you to where you are supposed to be. Every win, every loss, every heartbreak and every mistake. Don't be afraid to fuck up, and don't expect success overnight. Get lost, get so damn lost and find yourself over and over again. Believe in yourself, forget about what others think. Don't stop until you make yourself proud."_

  

How timely. 

  

Just when I was feeling like I had not achieved what I wanted to achieved fast enough; right when impatience got to me. I had always been bad at celebrating my [little wins](https://cowriters.app/words/little-wins-360535e3963e70f439); always moving on to the next goal when the current one is completed. But I'd never thought that if I do reach ALL my goals for the future today, life will become "pretty damn boring". 

  

It's also about the journey, not just the destination. The means, not just the ends. The process as well as the outcomes.

  

Of course, it's not at all possible to have "done it all already". Even if I reached all my goals today, I can always set new ones to chase immediately. But this would be nit-picking and that's besides the point. This is about being happy anyway, even before I reached my goals. Even if I don't achieve it. 

  

Have goals, dream bold dreams; be ambitious; hustle hard, but don't start an agreement with yourself that you can only be happy after you reached the goal. Be happy doing the work anyway. Be thankful for having the conditions—health, wealth, opportunity, security—come together to let us live this meaningful life. The [slow grind](https://cowriters.app/words/behind-every-story-of-overnight-success-is-a-slow-grind-you-never-heard-359905e3816b3ea7f7) is the fun part; overnight success can be more stressful actually, and probably over-rated anyway.

  

Have fun, slowly. Instead of boredom, fast.
