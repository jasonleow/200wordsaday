_I still don't know what to write, so I'm randomly choosing an emoji a day and writing 200 words about it. Another one of my writing slump cheats. Today it is_ ☕️_. Here goes:_

  

Ah, I love the smell of coffee in the morning. There's nothing quite like it. Soft rays of the rising sun peeking through the windows. The house is quiet, for now. No one stirs yet. The silent calm feels so precious though, because within the hour, all chaos breaks loose. But for now, the morning is to be savoured, just as this ritual for coffee. A new day calls out to you, the to-do list poking at the edges of your wakefulness. Not now. Not yet, your body says. Not until this, as you grind the first beans. Immediately, the roasty aroma fills the air, like perfume for the morning. Already your mind perks up a little, like an obedient Pavlovian dog. Next, a bit of alchemic ritual using hot water, milk and some glass and steel equipment that looks like it belongs in a chemistry lab, and voilà, the morning brew is done. There's something quite calming and charming about taking time to brew just as the day breaks. It's as though the mind and body needs time to slowly transition from dreams to wakefulness, and coffee is the bridge. And with the first sip......Hello, world!
