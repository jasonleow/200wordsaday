It's been a while since I had steak. Years probably. Not sure why I ever stopped...I guess because I loved chicken better? And steak had always felt a little too...heavy. But today I finally broke the mis-steak (haha pun intended). I like my steak medium well - cooked surface and slightly crispy, charred ends and bits, with the middle still slightly pink.Â 

  

That first taste of char-grill in your mouth... oh gosh, why had I ever stopped. The rich, gamey meat juices that run crazy in the universe that is my mouth. Suddenly, sparks flying and stars exploding. That taste, long time since but not forgotten by the tongue. It's like my body craved the meat. It's like meeting an old flame and remembering the fiery first kiss you shared. Before I finished chewing the first bite, I had to go for another, this time with some mustard. Smooth, creamy dijon mustard, lathered thick on the next bite. That tangy hot taste was a match made in heaven with the steak. Then came the grilled button mushrooms and red peppers. Is there anything as simple yet delicious as grilled vegetables just cooked in it's own juices, helped on by a tiny pinch of salt? That natural earthly sweetness. I never knew I missed grilled greens till I had them today.

  

There's just something satisfyingly primal about digging into a huge chunk of meat. Why and how was I ever a vegan for three years?!
