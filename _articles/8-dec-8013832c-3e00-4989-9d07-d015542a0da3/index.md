So it is. 8 Dec will be my last post here on 200wad. Inspired by @brandonwilson who's cutting it off at his two-year mark, I thought this will be a cool milestone to finish off my own journey too. 

I'd not taken any break from writing throughout my two-year streak, so it's a good time to reflect and think about how I can to take this daily writing habit further in the next season. It'll be timely to do this before starting on a fresh new streak on my new platform too. Yes, that'll be a fun experiment, to start afresh from Day Zero. The streak mechanism had always been useful for me, to keep me going when energy is low and motivation thin, especially in the beginning. But I often wondered how it would feel like if I started from zero again. Would I continue to feel motivated? Has my relationship with the streak mechanism changed after two full years of daily writing? How will zero help, or hinder? 

Honest take: I feel that it won't make much difference, at least from how I feel _now_ about intentionally breaking my streak. It's a useful device for consistency, but I feel like I found my deeper why, and whether the streak number is small or large doesn't feel like it matters all that much, in the larger scheme of things. It's like a game that you enjoy playing, even if you lose. Win, I'll play the next day. Lose, I'll still play the next day. 

Because the moment I write to think, to figure things out, to write my way towards inner clarity or outward goals, is the moment I have already won. Numbers or not.
