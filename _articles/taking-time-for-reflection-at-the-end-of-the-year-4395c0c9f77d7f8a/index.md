Day 3 of the #200wad challenge. Looking back at 2018.

  

It's December. For the past few years, I grown into the habit of taking some time off to reflect and recap on the year.

  

It started with just not scheduling work for a week or two during the Christmas-New Year period. Then last year it progressed to spending 1 month in Ubud, Bali for a solo personal retreat. I'm now writing this from Ubud again, in the midst of another month long retreat. This taking time away thing at the end of the year is getting pretty addictive. I actually look forward to it every year now.

  

_Why do I do this?_

  

It's just nice to slow down at the end of the year. We rush through all the months of the year, working hard, hustling, months zipping past us like minutes. So taking time off feels like taking back my sanity...albeit a little bit. It feels like I'm catching my breath, in mind and spirit. I can't quite imagine rushing through a new year without such a pit stop. There was one year where I worked through the holiday season. Bad idea. Went into the new year feeling exhausted. Already. That was a really bad way to start a new year.

  

I like to start a new year with optimism. A clear sense of purpose and direction. Feeling excited to do all the things I planned to do, experiences I want to live, love and laugh through.

  

I could do this too back at home in Singapore for sure. But yanking myself away from familiar surroundings help create distance for reflection. And Ubud is perfect for reflection - the nature lux; padi leaves rustling in the wind; rooster crowing; tangerine sunsets; delish nasi campur, soto ayam and sate; beautiful daily ceremonies and prayers the locals do religiously. All that sets my mind and body back to zero. It's as grounding as it's life-affirming.

  

Bye 2018. Hello 2019.
