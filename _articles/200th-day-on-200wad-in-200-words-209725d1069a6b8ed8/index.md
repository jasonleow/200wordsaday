So, it's my 200th post on 200wad here. A significant milestone? Not so sure anymore. Back when I was at 100, I was excited to reach 200. But now, at this point, it feels like a small check point in a lifetime of writing. Yes, _a lifetime_. If this 200-day journey had taught me anything, it was that I enjoy writing and benefit tremendously from daily writing. I have a feeling I'll continue to write daily, if not frequently, _for life_. 

  

Still, there's something catchy and punchy about **"200 on 200 in 200"**. So, the writer in me want to catch this one-time-only chance and log my learnings.

  

What did I learn so far?

  

Writing is cathartic, an emptying to be filled again 

Writing is thinking out loud, a mirror, a sense-making, awareness-giving process

Writing it down is reality-shaping, the first small step in making big dreams real

Writing is artistic experimentation not just in words, but in thought, action and life

Writing is an individual's journey but here we can journey alongside others

Writing daily is a painfully human journey - all our strengths and flaws, and everything in between

Our words are not our words, they come _through_ us (from others), not _from_ us
