Day 6 of the #200wad challenge. Listening to life.

  

Wake up. Wake up... Dim morning light, glowing behind the curtains. The blue hour, ah yes, my favourite time of the morning. The rooster calls. Nature's alarm clock. Blink, blink. yawns. Slowly, I wake.

  

Breathing in, I know that I am breathing in. Breathing out, I know that I am breathing out. Standing tall but loose in sun salutation, I feel my feet, my body, at rest, at peace. The meditation bell sounds. The chime fades slowly, drawing me out, pulling me back. Into the real world. 

  

Hello world. I am ready for you now. 

  

Then the world rushes by. The computer screen is another parallel universe altogether, with its own time and space. I hear nothing in there. Minutes in there, hours out here. The day ends, in the blink of an eye. 

  

......

  

Padi leaves rustling in the breeze, in a soothing sort of symphony I could sleep to. Cicadas buzzing; birds chirping. In a distance, in some temple, a local Balinese priest is chanting on a microphone. The sun hangs low now, peeking through the clouds. Golden hour in the rice fields is paradise. Finally, I can walk and move.

  

With each step, a pleasant sound of gravel scrunching and grating under my feet. It's strangely pleasing to hear and feel it. ASMR kicking in.

  

Peace is every step. I have arrived. I am home.
