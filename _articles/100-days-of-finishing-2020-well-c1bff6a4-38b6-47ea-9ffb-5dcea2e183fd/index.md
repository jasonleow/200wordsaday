Thank you @keni for reminding a bunch of us about this 100-day challenge we did last year, and that we have 100 days left of 2020.

How different things look this year compared to last year!

All the bold dreams and bright aspirations shattered within the first half of the year, and now we're only just barely picking back up pieces of ourselves...and 2020 is finishing? Why did it feel like 2020 can't be over fast enough, yet when it does it's like time had slipped through our fingers? I'm not sure if I had done well in 2020. Too busy surviving, coping, keeping it together. 

But now, we stand at the 100-day mark to the end of 2020, and I start asking myself: "How do I finish well?" Even if I didn't do that well so far, but now is the time to take it back and finish well! 

But what does finishing well even mean in a society recovering from a pandemic; with a looming economic recession and jobs and livelihoods lost; where kinships are harder than ever to maintain with social distancing?  

I don't know the answer at the time of writing. But perhaps the first step to finishing well is recognising that we have it within us to accomplish it already. Maybe in the context of a rapidly shifting context burdened by the weight of a pandemic, the best way forward to finishing well isn't with bold declarations and decisive proclamations, but giving ourselves permission to take time to figure out and to respond to whatever shit life throws at us, in an emergent, adaptive manner. A promise, that no matter what, we're not as disempowered as it seems, and finishing up 2020 with intention, dignity and grace is possible.

Yes, that's enough of an answer for me. Vague situations call for vague answers, and it's good enough.
