It's been a normal and easy past few months, and I feel ready to take things up a notch and get nuttier on my work, even as I continue to live by the themes from the past months (like following my energy in Oct).  

### **Sustain and take it higher**

*   Now that I'd completed [#100daysofcode,](#100daysofcode,) what next? I may have stop counting my streak, but will keep coding everyday, and start to **lay down the hours for my products** while continuing to have fun. A few days backend, a few days frontend? How do I share my [#decodingcoding](#decodingcoding) journey more publicly?
*   Switching my **daily writing to mid-day** feels like a better balance lifestyle-wise, so I will continue with that. That also means I can try to sleep even earlier.
*   Building on my 3 x tiny workouts in the day, by doing more body **stretches**. 

### **Start anew**

*   I'd been procrastinating about **launching** a few things like my social impact patronage and custom Carrd side biz, so in the spirit of going nutty, I'll just launch them this month and see what happens.
*   Talking about launching my **social impact patronage**, I want to get started thinking about what it means to scale my social impact work, why it matters, how to involve patrons and what to do.
*   I'm starting something nutty for Keto List - an IG account posting **keto-related memes**. Why? Because it's fun! Not sure how it will help Keto List but this is one project where I feel like I can do anything that suits my personality and style. 

### **Stop - stuff I should stop doing**

*   Being **too sedentary** at home. COVID had totally changed me from someone who must go out every day, to being too couch-potato comfortable at home. Going out more, working outside for a day, and taking walks/runs.

_Screw normal. Go nutty._
