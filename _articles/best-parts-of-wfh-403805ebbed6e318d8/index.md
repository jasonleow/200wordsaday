What's the best parts about working from home, now that we all have to? 

  

⏰ Time and sanity saved from crowded commutes in the morning and evening.

? No pants, no shirts, no socks, no shoes. This is a game-changer. Why do we need those to work anyway!?

? No need for expensive drinks and team lunches, just for networking and team spirit.

? No bullsh\*t face-to-face politics. Zoom downplays all forms of sarcastic remarks, annoying comments, gestural power plays, thank god. 

?‍?‍?‍? More family time, with children and spouse, having meals, random play time, etc. For some this is a con, yes I know. If so, this is a signal for you to fix things in the family. 

? So much more less consumption and more $avings. When you have to go to an office to work, it comes with a certain lifestyle and all the associated costs of that lifestyle - clothes, shoes, meals, transport, drinks, accessories. All that goes away when you WFH.

? Less carbon release, better for the planet. No fumes from your car. No need for massive air-conditioning in the building and everything that runs in it. Your office is now your laptop. Can't beat the energy savings! 

  

To be honest, after such an extended period of time working from home, I must say, I kinda hooked now. And that's surprising to myself, because I'd always been a out-and-about guy. I could work from home but I always preferred to work outside in cafes. Initially when we were all forced to stay home, I was super resistant to it. But now, I'm easing into it. The benefits seem to outweigh the costs, it seems. Come to think of it, in the first place the costs were more psychological and habitual, all in my head anyway. I think, even if the lockdown measures are lifted, I'm going to want to stay home to work more often than heading out. 80:20 at least, or out for a day within a 5-day work week.

  

New normal, indeed.
