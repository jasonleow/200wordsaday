It's been slightly over a month since I returned from my last epic trip in Japan. And already I'm itching to go somewhere...again. The wanderlust is real.

  

Should I revisit old haunts that I loved? Bali? Iceland? Japan in summer this time? Or should I try out a new adventure and go somewhere I had never been? 

  

Sometimes, I feel like going somewhere totally foreign, and unplanned. Just to see what happens. Get lost, wander, suffer a little. Because in the little self-inflicted hardship, lies the seed of an unforgettable memory. But most days now, I long to deepen my experience in one or a few things. Cities included. I want to savour that different life in a refreshingly familiar city, slowly. And because these places resonated, I want to find out more why it did, or was it just superficial, or will it continue to resonate.

  

It's kind of like eating out. Some days, you just want to walk down some new street you'd never been, see a queue in front of a restaurant and just jump on it to try. Other times, you really enjoy eating at one place and want to explore their entire menu. I feel more and more like the latter these days. Is it age? Or just a craving for depth rather than breadth? Or perhaps I'm just a boring person. 

  

So......explore the new, or revisit the favourites? Either way, I'll enjoy the novelty, and I just can't wait!
