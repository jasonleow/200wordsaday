@vickenstein [talked](https://200wordsaday.com/words/serendipitous-202505d04809a4bc73) about how we're no longer allowing for much serendipity in our lives these days. It's sooo true, and such a nice reminder. In our rush to be every more efficient and optimised, we forget that getting lost and allowing for serendipity actually gives more outsized joy in our lives than shaving off a few minutes.  

  

Because when was the last time we experienced deep joy to use an app that allowed us to catch a train without waiting for another 5min? But I dare bet there were more occasions where you enjoyed accidental finds of a restaurant, or a shop, because you ventured down a street you never took. This gets especially amplified when traveling - I have more vivid and nostalgic recollection of places that I stumbled on, than the ones I researched beforehand to visit. I had called this [aimlessness as a travel mode](https://200wordsaday.com/words/aimlessness-as-a-travel-mode-133595c9b6c76d5528) then, but it should really just be **serendipity**!Â 

  

And that got me thinking: besides real places in real life, how can we allow for serendipity in our online lives as well? When have we ventured outside of our internet bubble and really dig into alternative points of view, or searched out random but interesting communities to engage in?

  

Grateful for the timely prompt, because it's the weekend, and I'll go search for serendipity now!
