I loved @twizzle 's post [Demoning](https://200wordsaday.com/words/demoning-191845cf43d688be18) yesterday. He talked about how being a demon isn't easy, there's lots of paperwork, bureaucracy, and key performance indicators (oh yes, they had KPIs even in hell!). It's hilarious as hell! 

  

I always loved such juxtapositions. It's not a new genre, and has been done to hell. Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey comes to mind. More recently, Miracle Workers, starring Daniel Radcliffe. 

  

### So I had an idea: what if I blatantly plagiarised a case study from Harvard Business Review, and just swopped the business terms with terms from heaven/hell? 

  

Wouldn't that be fun!? And by plagiarising and posting it here, I'm also slaying one of the sacred cows of writing here - [no plagiarism](https://200wordsaday.com/words/what-are-the-sacred-cows-of-200wad-190645cf28cbb7018b). So, here goes. You can read the [original HBR case study synopsis here](https://hbr.org/product/can-you-fix-a-toxic-culture-without-firing-people-commentary-for-hbr-case-study/R1806Z-PDF-ENG):

The Satanic Holdings had made it through the armageddon crisis of 2008 without losing power, but Hell, its theme park division (known for immersive entertainment experiences), had not fared as well. It had the unfortunate distinction of having been the group's poorest-performing unit for nearly a decade. As CEO (Chief Execution Officer), Lucifer was, of course, concerned about the numbers. But after spending time in the underworld, she worried they might be facing a bigger problem. She knew the park had been through years of belt-tightening and turnover, so she hadn't expected a warm welcome, but the negative vibe she'd felt from the demon employees had been even worse than she'd expected. The word that kept popping into her mind was "toxic." "Venomous" even. A numbers person, Lucifer had assumed that once the division was out of the red (the soul numbers were low), the demon problems would go away. Now she wondered if the low morale and disengagement was a problem a spreadsheet just couldn't fix.

Now that's one hell of a business case study. Should I continue plagiarising.. _erhem_ writing more? ;D
