[September](https://writelier.com/sweet-september-446395f4e5c1677437) went by much faster than I realised. While not as emotionally intense and high as August, I did end up doing quite a bit when I scrolled through my logs on Makerlog. It's one of those months where I did more than I realised, but didn't give myself enough credit and encouragement for it. Thankfully I do monthly wrap-ups!

### **Sustain and take it higher**

*   **Daily hour of code** continues to be the highlight. I really dug deep this month with Vue and Rails. Had loads of fun making tiny tools on Carrd using Vue, like a [Google Sheet as database open startup page](https://openstartup.carrd.co/); playing with GSAP animations to make an [accordion drop-downs](https://animatedaccordionfaqs.carrd.co/) that drop with an animated bounce; and marvelling at localStorage through [to-do list mini-apps](https://throwaway-todolist-2.carrd.co/). For the first time, I was stumped for days on an issue integrating [my very first Rails API](https://github.com/jasonleow/todolist-restapi) with my Vue app. My first taste of coder madness. 
*   Realising my **kid-in-a-candy-store moment** with coding and [Codepen](Vue 250+ https://codepen.io/collection/DrqowN). This felt like striking gold, because I don't get that feeling of deep satisfaction and excitement often in my career, and now there's one for the taking anytime. Discovered Glitch, Tailwind
*   Continued with my **tech for good volunteering**, and helped a volunteer initiative called [Call Home](https://callhome.sg) to launch their marketing landing page. I really enjoy doing this work, and foresee myself doing more. I'm considering launching a [tech for good patronage](https://writelier.com/social-impact-patronage-039c83ba-8f8f-4670-b955-b3d9ad31546c) on Buy Me A Coffee to pay for domains and servers for more such work! 
*   Brought **Keto List** to the next stage - more **monetization** hacks. Added CTAs for coffees on every blog post, and added new ad products, and it worked! This month was a fruitful month for Keto List, with revenue of $585. Probably my highest ever so far for this hobby project!
*   This month was a **month of many firsts**! Money woes got a bit of a breather when I got a $4k+ for my first ever Zoom speaking engagement for Oct. Popped my Stack Overflow cherry and posted my first ever question there – grateful I didn't get slammed by the elites, and I ended up answering my own question! Bought my first ever Facebook ad for Grant Hunt chatbot, as part of the grant money I secured. So much to learn about how to run ads and optimise that pot of money! My proudest moment near the end of Sept was when I got my first monthly subscription patron member for my tech for good patronage! Just deeply grateful and excited that anyone would want to give me money to do such work.

### **Start anew**

*   **Fitness** was dismal as per previous months, but at least I found a way to steal time by optimising the mundane - I ended up doing 3 sets of short exercises (pushups, planks, squats) over a day. Not done runs yet, still yet to find a window where it works with baby care. I wish to renew my runs, somehow!
*   **Sleep** is worse, and I'm sleeping later than the intended 11.30pm. Sleep really is the base foundation for what makes a great month from an okay month, and being disciplined and protective about my sleep is something I need to renew.

### **Stop - stuff I should stop doing**

*   Got **hacked** on my Wordpress sites again this month. It's such a pain in the ass, and such an unproductive use of my time. I should really stop using Wordpress and migrate my sites to JAMstack or to static. [**#fuckwordpress**](<strong>#fuckwordpress</strong>)
*   Phone died for good, and had an [**accidental digital detox**](https://writelier.com/accidental-digital-detox-57c95471-0793-4f61-a497-1529cede366a) which felt good and learned some surprising things about what I really need my phone for. I should stop being tied to my phone so much and do more intentional detoxes more frequently.

_Onward to October!_
