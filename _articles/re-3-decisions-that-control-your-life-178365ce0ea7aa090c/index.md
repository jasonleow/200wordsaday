Love the 3 decisions! Simple to understand and to put into practice. What I'm interpreting:  

  

*   Focus on what you have instead of what you don't = Gratitude vs bitterness
*   Focus on what you can control instead of what you can't = Acceptance vs self-victimization
*   Dreaming about the possibilities of the future instead of dwelling on the failures of the past = Optimism vs pessimism

  

Practice gratitude, acceptance, optimism. Avoid bitterness, self-victimization, pessimism.

  

How does one practice the 3 practices? Some I tried or want to try...

  

**Gratitude** - I once kept a gratitude jar. Everyday, I wrote on a scrap of paper, something that I am grateful for on that day. Anything. You could also keep a gratitude journal. Last time when I had an office job, I like to leave post-its on people's desk to thank them for something. These days, I write about beautiful experience and perfect days here on 200wad, as a way to be thankful of it. And always say thank you, inwardly and outwardly...

  

**Acceptance** - grow muscles for a bias towards action. Always ask, what can we do? What can we realistically influence now? If we can't move something now, what could we look out for in the future, to act on? I always try this at work, when we hit some wall for a project. It works. For personal life, I wish to practice this more, because I tend to stubbornly bang my head against the wall multiple times for things I can't control with regards to personal projects and goals. Breath, let the anger and frustration settle, be with it. Then ask that same question again - what can I do now?

  

**Optimism** - I find I'm practising optimism a lot on 200wad. I write about the [future](https://200wordsaday.com/words/2024-envision-your-future-5-years-from-now-173625cda2ace61902) that I envision. I write about my plans, my hopes, my aspirations. I read other people's plan and aspirations here, and elsewhere - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. And Instagram needs a special mention - seeing all the beautiful images of a world I had not yet seen, makes me long for the day I can finally do. It's my optimism machine, Instagram. I bookmark photos in thematic albums - wanderlust, making, stuff I want. All these, like a mood board, a bucket list, of future projects to act on. Now, I'm seeking ways to have [a mind's diet](https://200wordsaday.com/words/n-a-180385ce405a218540) that gives me light and energy, and a tangible, real-life way to be a [traveller in your own country](https://200wordsaday.com/words/how-does-one-be-a-traveller-in-your-own-city-179315ce2a4918e70f). All to feel hope and optimism, for what is to come.

  

_Repeat to self: Thank you. What can I do now? I'm looking forward to..._
