Since 2016, I had been using the 8 forms of capital framework by [Ethan Roland & Gregory Landua](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/8-forms-of-capital/), to think ahead for what I would like to achieve for the year. I did one [last year](https://200wordsaday.com/words/2019-bucket-list-in-8-forms-of-capital-15135c2b037ee378a) which I shared on 200wad. For the uninitiated, the 8 forms are: 

  

? **Financial capital:** money, financial instruments, investments

⚒️ **Material capital:** possessions, natural resources, tools, infrastructure

? **Living capital:** nature, land, ecosystems, animals, health (my own addition)

? **Intellectual capital:** ideas, knowledge, words, images, intellectual property

? **Experiential capital:** action, embodied experienced, worldly wisdom

? **Social capital:** connections, relationships, influence

? **Cultural capital:** song, story, ritual, art, theatre, community customs

⛩️ **Spiritual capital:** prayer, faith, beliefs, spiritual attainment

  

I love how it nudges me to think holistically, beyond the usual career, wealth, health categories of life goals. The main idea is that capital isn't just financial; it is also all these other 7 of them, which can be transformed into financial capital and vice versa. 

  

But after 4 cycles, I realised I don't stick to one-third to half the goals I set at the beginning of the year for these 8 forms of capital. That's because:

  

*   It's hard to plan S.M.A.R.T goals for a whole year ahead. Things happen during the year, and the goals need to evolve, or get dropped. 
*   I add in goals anyway to areas I don't feel much for, hence it doesn't get much love. Downsides of using a fill-in-the-blanks framework.
*   My monthly goals are now a more realtime measure of my progress, and that's taking up a lot of effort, so I forget/don't align and track my monthly goals to the 8 forms of capital yearly ones. Tracking fatigue.

  

But there's still some value in doing this for the year ahead, so I decided that I can use this framework for **setting broader intentions** in these 8 areas of life. The broader intentions can then be the North Star to softly guide the monthly goals/experiments I set. Kind of like a funnel, what I said about [tracking time, energy and direction](https://200wordsaday.com/words/hybrid-data-on-personal-growth-tracking-time-energy-and-direction-332795e00ba2456fed). 

  

OK, so my intentions for 2020 are: 

  

### "[I want to see if I can](https://200wordsaday.com/words/instead-of-i-will-say-i-want-to-see-if-i-can-327365df3951aaf870)...

? **Financial:** Be audacious and earn $1mil ARR by 1 Jan 2021 

⚒️ **Material:** Via negativa - remove more, tidy often.

? **Living:** Stabilize my health on ketofast, get into more biohacking.

? **Intellectual:** Continue reading everyday - money, coding, biohacking, growth. Whatever sparks my curiosity.

? **Experiential:** Consistency is key. Practice makes perfect. Remember that for career, coding and health.

? **Social:** Less real-life interactions, less local, more online connections, more global.

? **Cultural:** Enjoy what fascinates me, embrace the weird - space, alternative history, Japan.

⛩️ **Spiritual:** Trial by fire of fatherhood. Surprise me baby.

  

All these probably sound like bullshit now, because I'm experimenting with the 8 forms of capital in a new way, so efficacy is uncertain. Work-in-progress, for sure. Will report back.
