Just when you thought you learned the lesson, life throws one last test at you, just to be sure. Often it happens sneakily. The big lesson has been taught and learned, and it's been some time since the last relapse. Things are now going smooth and peachy, and you're starting to wonder that perhaps this time is really the last time you'll ever pass through this mental landscape. You feel glad and grateful, proud even. Well done, you pat yourself on the back. 

But no. Just to be sure, the universe had thrown a far boomerang early on, to return just when you least expect it. Just when you start to rest on your laurels. Exactly when you start to feel complacent and comfortable. Perhaps, too comfortable. It's telling you, the learning is never completely done. There's new things to discover, old lessons to reinforce. 

Would you respond in the old way, or recall your hand at the last minute and act in the way that the lesson had taught? Your actions now stands on the knife edge – either side, a sharp drop into the past habits and re-learning tiresome old lessons. Or you continue walking along that knife edge, alert and aware, not tempted by old monsters, determined.

I find myself at this intersection. One last test. 

That I'm writing this, shows there's some hope. That I've not been ensnared. Yet. We'll see. We'll see, soon enough.
