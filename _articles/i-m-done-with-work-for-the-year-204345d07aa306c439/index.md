Or at least I feel like it. I'd been so busy with consultancy projects right off the bat in the new year. Feels like I'm only catching my breath now.

  

_Phew. Sigh. Breathessssssss._

  

It's a nice feeling to have. The feeling that your work is done, and you leave home for the day feeling accomplished, productive, and nothing to worry about for the evening. Ever felt that before at the end of your work day? Now try to imagine doing that for your work year. That's how I feel right now. Worked on 2 ultra meaningful design projects for the public good. Did my best. Finished what I set out to finish. All loose ends tied. Nothing left to worry about. No work for the rest of the year, unless I choose to.

  

It's a nicer feeling to have, to know that I had made enough for the year. To know I can subsist on that, and have the freedom to do stuff that I want. Anything I want. Everything I want. Nothing I want.

  

That's how I roll. Pendulum swings from one extreme to another. Summer today, winter tomorrow. Sprint hard for months on end. Then do nothing at all.Â 

  

Nothing.
