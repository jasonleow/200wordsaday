Overheard this on the interwebs today. It's so important a message for myself that I want to write something about it, kind of like a note to self.

  

**"Progression, not perfection."**

  

A similar one you might have heard before is "Perfect is the enemy of good." by Voltaire, but that just doesn't resonate as well for me. Because very often what motivates me in my work isn't choosing between good enough but launched versus the perfect one that never sees the light of day. It's not about putting things out into the world. It's never about changing the world. The real dichotomy is between scrappy, baby steps kind of progress/growth versus trying to be polished perfect and getting overwhelmed. 

  

Because my entrepreneurship journey is really a vehicle for personal growth; recurring revenue just a means for recurring meaning. Not just progress in a business sense but also in the personal and spiritual. And what often hinders me is thinking far too many steps ahead towards that level of perfection, and getting scared or overwhelmed. The faraway future that I want puts me off the immediate effort needed in the present. Basically, getting in my own way, tripping over my own shoelaces.

  

But Rome wasn't built in a day. Babies crawl before they can walk. 

  

So...... progression, not perfection.
