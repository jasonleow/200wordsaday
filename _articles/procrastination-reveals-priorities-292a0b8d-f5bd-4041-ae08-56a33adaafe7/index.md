Today on platitude Twitter:

> Procrastination often reveals what's uninteresting, unimportant and non urgent. Are those the kind of things you want to spend your energy on? ~ @dvassallo

I got to admit, there's been some projects which I mentioned I will do this month that I had been procrastinating about – the custom Carrd company and my social impact patronage. I had asked around for feedback, sussed things out, and both ideas have some potential. I should really just go for it and launch a rough MVP. But I often catch myself procrastinating. Something feels off, but I'm not sure what. It could just be the modern ailment of over-thinking things. Or could it be signalling what @dvassallo is saying, that it's really not all that interesting, important or urgent? Because if it was, wouldn't I have already jumped onto it, without hesitation? Or is that too high a benchmark to go by? 

Does everything need to be a "HELL YEAH!!" to deserve to get done? There's so many tasks within a day that we do because we need to, either out of habit and routine, or just stuff that keeps life going. We can procrastinate over many things, but human motivation is complex and multi-faceted. Can we really pin it down to something being uninteresting, unimportant and non-urgent _just because_ we procrastinate? We could be having a low energy day. Or feeling burned out from work in general. Or there's other competing priorities that's even more important than that important task that we're procrastinating on. That doesn't mean it's necessarily unimportant, is it?

Maybe this is what I need to do: remove all the other possible factors that might possibly be causing my procrastination, and then see if I still reluctant to do it. Tired? Sleep. Burned out? Take a break from work. There's other priorities? Complete them first. Then come back to it and see if you still feel the same. 

If there's anything I learned from this exercise of writing it out to think, it's that I need to be more discerning with platitude Twitter. It always sounds so fancy and resonant, but reflect deeper in each tweet, it starts to break down.
