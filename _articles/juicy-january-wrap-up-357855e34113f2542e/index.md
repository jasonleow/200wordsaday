For the month of January—dubbed [Juicy January](https://cowriters.app/words/juicy-january-336225e0c7591b0fb8)—I had set out to experiment and learn more about marketing and monetization:

  

*   growth hacking, and how to set up acquisition channels
*   content marketing, to provide value and get the product in front of potential customers
*   conversion funnels, to convert interested shoppers into paying customers
*   monetization strategies, or how to get people to open up their wallets

  

### **Checking off stuff that I'd done:**

✅ Scoured various platforms for prospects who are in the service business —Indie Hackers, Starter Story, Fiverr, 99Designs, Upwork, Carousell, Makerlog, Craigslist, Productized Startups Facebook group. [Give value back](https://cowriters.app/words/juicy-january-marketing-experiments-344135e19ccb389964) to the communities, shared backlinks. Collected over 20 possible prospects.

✅ Created profiles on freelancer sites (Upwork, 99Designs, Fiverr) and ad platforms (like Makerads.xyz) not so much to get gigs but to backlink to Sweet Jam Sites.

✅ Cold site as a proposal: Created demo JAMstack sites using a potential customer's existing website, and cold-emailing them a link to the demo site to get interest. I did this for about 5 customers. Conducted lots of cold marketing experiments, including one that said "This is a cold email".

✅ In the process of closing my very first project from a cold demo site. It's just USD199 but hey, small wins!

✅ Hit 100 items on Keto List! A milestone for sure.

✅ Added advertising for Keto List Singapore and reached out to possible sponsor. Going to meet him next week.

✅ Observed that I need to create my own community for Keto List instead of depending on other people's platforms, and started a Telegram group. Also joined tangential communities like for diabetes, health.

✅ Got traffic uptick due to seasonal/festive themes on Keto List, especially this month for the Chinese New Year theme. A great content marketing idea that I will replicate throughout the year. 

✅ Planned out [money habit systems](https://cowriters.app/words/how-do-i-make-a-million-dollars-experiments-in-keystone-money-habits-346785e1eff6d4b06d) on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis. Started a [book journal](https://cowriters.app/words/get-serious-with-a-habit-by-making-it-physical-experiential-353825e2ba4f4a9e39) to track my money habits more tangibly.

✅ Tracked monthly household expenditure, and discussed with wife where we can spend less, save more.

✅ Read these books: 

*   Dollars And Sense
*   Secrets of the Millionaire Mind
*   The Millionaire Next Door
*   Head Strong

  

  

### **Some learning points**

**You can't monetize an audience you don't have.**

The funnel matters. Awareness > Consideration > Decision > Retention. I can't monetize (Decision, Retention) when I got no traffic (Awareness). "Duh!", but trust a marketing noob to make this stupid mistake. Lesson well learned, for sure. I got to start from the beginning all over again, and get more content out, optimize my site's SEO, and experiment in Google and Facebook ads. Marketing is a long game, and I need more patience that I initially expected.

  

**Marketing alone cannot cover up a poor product**

I remembered saying that for January, I wanted to do more marketing and monetization, less development. More selling, less making. But after trying to so hard to sell my products, I realised that perhaps the value propositions on my products actually aren't all that strong. Of course, I need to continue iterating on making the value propositions stronger.  But I shouldn't put all my eggs in one basket too—perhaps I need to continue making new products, until something with a really strong value proposition really sticks. I also always went for the [under-served, ultra-niche approach](https://cowriters.app/words/under-served-ultra-niche-vs-over-crowded-mainstream-market-355985e30207c79de5) when it comes to making products. But I'm ready to try a different tack now—selling to a over-crowded mainstream market. Above all, make products that [are painkillers, not just vitamins](https://cowriters.app/words/juicy-january-marketing-experiments-344135e19ccb389964).

  

**Making vs selling: 2 distinct skillsets**

I realised I enjoy the act of creating more than the act of storytelling. Some people are born marketers, great at selling a story about their product. I'm not. Again, this is an inner narrative that's blocking my progress, and something that I have to continue to work on. I remembered how irksome I felt sending out that very first cold email on 1 Jan. After sending out many and getting the cold shoulder, I feel much more thick skinned now lol.  

  

**More haste, less speed**

Again, old lessons. I'd put too much stress on myself this month to monetize. Ended up falling sick big time (AGAIN). [My body is my harshest teacher.](https://cowriters.app/words/somatic-awakening-354665e2da0a55f70b) And knocked me out for 1 week and I'm still reeling from it. It's so pointless. The more hasty and impatient I get, the less fun I have, the less productive I get, and the less impact I achieve. I have to be impatient with actions but patient with results. And not forgetting that fun is the ultimate creator, and the universe works fast when I'm having fun. I definitely need to be [more intentional with stress management](https://cowriters.app/words/what-do-you-do-for-fun-habits-for-stress-management-356555e314cc26d1d5) and play, outside of work.
