Some thoughts after being a digital nomad in Ubud, Bali for one month. Is it all it's hyped out to be?  

  

### ? It's awesome!

? The change in environment and the freedom to do so is definitely refreshing and energizing. A common digital nomad refrain is "_If I could be working anywhere, then why not somewhere on the beach/jungle/mountain_?" This definitely resonates. Just being in a new place puts you on a more motivated, productive high to work.   

  

? When I'm not working, I get to see new places, discover delicious new foods/coffee, experience things I'd never be able to do back home. I particularly enjoyed commuting to work on my scooter instead of on the crowded train, having nice food and coffee while at work, and having new routines like taking lovely [evening walks](https://200wordsaday.com/words/encountering-beauty-a-photo-essay-8015c14976f89e91). You don't get bored as much because there's still a lot of novelty, and it's easy to get new inspiration for creative ideas. 

  

? Being physically away from family and friends does mean there's a lot less social commitments. That means more time to focus on your project. I found I could get into the flow of deep work because there's simply less distractions socially. By being away from friends also mean there's a kind of a vacuum that yearns to be filled with new friends. I think one's social life starts to get narrower as career takes off and family comes in. So being away means it's a great way to get out of the comfort zone and to network again.

  

? There's some savings to be had especially if the cost of living back home is higher and you're staying at relatively cheaper destinations like in Bali. Your personal life situation also shapes how much saving you can have by being a DN. My savings was only in some areas, like transport and entertainment. I'm actually paying more for accommodation because I have to still continue with my monthly payments on my house back home anyway. I cook more back home, so eating out everyday in Bali didn't save that much comparatively. So the DN lifestyle seems to work best for folks who are single, no property, rent, don't cook much, and where there's expensive transport options for daily commute.     

  

_Next: it's actually less awesome than I thought._

  

? Day 18 of the #200wad challenge. Separately, **Merry Christmas** everyone! ???
