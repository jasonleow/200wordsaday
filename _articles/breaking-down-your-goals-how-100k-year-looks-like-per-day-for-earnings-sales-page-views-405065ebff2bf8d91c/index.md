I saw this on Twitter, and even though I had done a variation of it before, @dvassallo's [breakdown of a $100k target in his tweet](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1251695615559389184?s=21) managed to make it even more tangible and concrete:

  

> _$100K/year_

> _... can be visualized as $8,300/month_

> _... which can be visualized as $270/day_

> _... which can be visualized as 7 sales of $39_

> _... which can be visualized as 140 views @ 5% conversion_

  

Wow that's crazy clear, isn't it?! I was mindblown when I read it. Because he didn't just breakdown an annual goal into a daily one, but also moved down the sales/marketing funnel to further visualise how it looks like as a daily sales target, and conversion target and how many page views he should be getting. That makes it so damn actionable and attainable.

  

So just as an experiment to apply what I learned, if my goal this year is:

  

> **I will earn $1mil ARR by end 2020. In return, I will have fun growing my indie products, and adhere to a healthy, millionaire habit system. And I will practice surrender.**

  

Then using @dvassallo's breakdown, it should look like:

  

**$1mil/year**

**... can be visualized as $83,333/month**

**... which can be visualized as $2,777/day**

**... which can be visualized as 71 sales of $39**

**... which can be visualized as 1420 views @ 5% conversion**

  

I think I can research a bit and tweak the parameters to suit my industry, type of product, sales cycle, etc (because why $39? Maybe that's his SaaS pricing. Or why 5% conversion? Maybe I can replace with my conversion rate. Or maybe I don't have daily sales, so I can make it weekly or per meaningful season instead.).

  

But in any case, having those targets are a great way to guide action, don't you think? Just looking at it gives me clarity on the traffic I need to build, the conversion I need to make, and a daily sales target (which could be broken down further into how many cold emails sent out perhaps).

  

37% of the year had passed, and I'm so far from this audacious goal of mine that it's laughable to even try. No one could have predictable this curve ball called COVID. I certainly didn't when I planned that goal. But perhaps precisely because it's laughable to try that it gets easier, because there's no more pressure! I got the best excuse ever, i.e. COVID.Â 

  

No harm trying anyway...what do I got to lose at this point?
