@lucjah just asked a really [good question](https://200wordsaday.com/words/10-years-of-meditation-what-changed-172875cd9600d79ee5) that no one had ever asked me before, about my meditation origin story. 

  

> maybe you can include, as Im curious, how your meditating path started... What is your... meditating tradition (method)? Have you attended any meditating retreats?

  

The dates are a blur, but here's a rough timeline:

  

**2005 -** I started getting curious about meditation after chancing upon a book at Borders bookstore in London. It's probably _Peace Is Every Step_ or _The Miracle Of Mindfulness_, by Thich Nhat Hanh. I was working and living in London for a year, and the extended time away had given me lot of space to work through the quarter life crisis I was going through then. That's a whole different story for another time, another post. But anyway, it was in such an emotionally difficult time that I sought out meditation. 

  

**2006 -** My working holiday visa is up, and my time in London comes to a close. I decide to use the tax returns I claimed back to travel for 6 months in France. I love France. I worked in Discovery Channel in London and one of my jobs there was to monitor the Discovery Travel & Living UK channel, and after watching so many episodes of travel shows in the south of France, I'm hooked. But I hate doing the whirlwind backpacker thing where you spend a day or two in a city then Eurail out to the next. So I decide to do slow travel, reflect before heading home. Which better place to reflect than in monasteries? I decide to go to Plum Village. 

  

**Late 2006 -** I do a one month retreat in a [Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Toulouse](https://200wordsaday.com/words/tibet-in-toulouse-3-157945cc31c0dc4500), south of France. Then travel in [Marseilles](https://200wordsaday.com/words/marseilles-mediterranean-mad-159765cc66b594587a), Aix en Provence before heading to Bordeaux for my [3 month retreat](https://jasonleow.sg/191/buddhism-in-bordeaux/) in Plum Village. It's my first time there, but I decide to leap into the deep end into meditation anyway. Learned loads about mindfulness, mindful living, sitting, standing, eating, walking, working, everything. Life-changing experience. Nothing is the same again.

  

**2007-2014 -** Continues to learn more about this tradition. It's like something opened up. And I was hungry for more. Also turned serious vegan. The no-meat, no-dairy, no-egg, no-animal-derivatives-of-any-kind, no-leather, no-honey type. The next 7 years, went on many retreats, local and overseas. Tried out the meditation traditions of Korea, Tibet. Went to [India for a pilgrimage](https://200wordsaday.com/words/bodhgaya-158465cc4706f5f833). Then back to India again for a month of [yoga](https://200wordsaday.com/words/wandergrief-rishikesh-151085cb72d6ebac37) after that. Even dabbled a bit in the shamanistic traditions. I was basically doing my apprenticeship rounds in the various ancient wisdom lineages. 

  

**Late 2014 -** My last big retreat back at [Plum Village in 2014](https://200wordsaday.com/words/summer-in-plum-village-152925cb9e31a2487d). This was also the last summer my teacher Thich Nhat Hanh was healthy. Not long after, he had a serious stroke. He's now back in Vietnam, living at his root temple, probably to live out his last days. 

  

**2015-2019 -** practice is ongoing, but my practice intensity are fading. If I count the seasons of my spiritual journey in cycles of 7 years, the first 7 years had been about education, the next 7 was slowly stagnating. Now, I'm on the cusp of the next 7 year cycle. I feel restless and eager to take it to the next level. Perhaps more learning? But would it be just confined to the meditative traditions? I don't know. But 2020 onwards will be interesting to observe.
