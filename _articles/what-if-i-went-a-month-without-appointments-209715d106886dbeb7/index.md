@philh said in his [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/off-the-grid-208595d0e5f5053c27) "I feel the need of completely cutting off myself from the grid." and that resonated. I just finished some big work projects and feel like I'm in pre-burnout stage from work, or a "brownout". I need a break. Though it is unlikely that I can go completely off the grid- no internet, no electricity, no contact - for the time being due to other commitments, I wonder if there are other ways I can still have some semblance of being 'off the grid' while still being in the city.  

  

**What if I went a month without having any appointments on my calendar?** Off the calendar grid, so to speak. But why would I want to do that?

  

Work events, lunches, coffees, meetups and any sort of face-to-face appointments relating to work tend to take energy away from me. Being introvert by nature, my socialising energy is precious, and so if I run it dry like I did for the past few months, I teeter dangerously close to burnout. I can feel it. That desire to be a recluse, a hermit, to distance myself from people and civilisation for a period of time. So it makes sense, that in order to top the tank back up, I should shy away from work appointments for a while. Thankfully, my work arrangements allow me that [option](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-m-done-with-work-for-the-year-204345d07aa306c439). For that I am grateful. 

  

But I think I don't have to shy away from other types of social appointments, like spending time with my wife and family. These events energise me, tops up the tank. Those don't count.

  

So the principle here seems to be: **top up the tank by avoiding social appointments that deplete me, and go for those that energise me.**

  

July is approaching, so it's decided then! July shall be my 'off the grid' month - a month without work appointments and work! A month just dedicated to replenishing my tank of inspiration, creativity and motivation. I need to resist jumping back into working on my side projects. Not quite yet ready. 

  

Already I'm starting to search out these energising sources - listening to podcasts again, seeking out fresh ideas in books, art and music, going to the library, bookstores, art exhibitions, exploring new music on Soundcloud, maybe travel a bit. Already I feel that slow waking from within the heart, a spirited spirit sobering up, inspiration and inspiring ideas briefly flashing past, fleetingly. I can't quite latch on to them as yet, but already these effects seem promising.  

  

So...... what do you do to top up your tank?
