If you're an indie hacker and making products for other indie hackers is your game, then the Indie Hackers groups is definitely something to get product ideas from. To date, there's 42 groups:

  

*   YouTubers
*   Coronavirus
*   Newsletter Crew
*   Writing Feedback
*   Remote Workers
*   Self Care
*   Developers
*   Learning to Code
*   Growth
*   Ethics
*   Landing Page Feedback
*   Product Development
*   Beta Testing
*   Productivity
*   Self Development
*   Jobs
*   Legal, Tax, & Accounting
*   Deals
*   Design and UX
*   Money (Pricing)
*   Virtual Meets
*   Ideas and Validation
*   Indie Swap
*   Indie Parents
*   New York City
*   The Seven Figure Club
*   The Five Figure Club
*   Course Creators
*   Productized Services
*   The Six Figure Club
*   San Francisco
*   London
*   Digital Nomads
*   No-Code
*   Community Building
*   Podcasters
*   Book Club
*   Meetups
*   Meta
*   Looking to Partner Up
*   AMAs
*   Daily Stand-up

  

I previously written about unbundling Craigslist. This is similar. Just reading through the different groups and the discussion threads, you get a ton of ideas. In fact, each group in itself can have a dedicated community, with their own forum, Telegram chat group. 

  

Each group could also potentially be a product in itself. Just some examples of groups matched to an existing product already available out there:

  

*   Jobs - Remote OK
*   Newsletter Crew - Substack
*   Legal, Tax, & Accounting - Freshbooks
*   Deals - Honey
*   Design and UX - Refactoring UI, Tailwind
*   Productized Services - Productized Startups Community
*   Digital Nomads - Nomadlist
*   No-Code - Makerpad
*   Podcasters - Anchor.fm
*   Meetups - Meetups (the app)

  

Even though there's already existing products serving those groups, it's not a stretch to see how there can be space for many more alternatives. And there are many groups that's under-served actually. Groups like the following, and potential ideas:

  

*   Coronavirus - this is huge. In crisis there's also opportunity. What kind of products can you make to address the disruption faced by individuals, companies and industries due to the pandemic?
*   Writing Feedback - instead of roasting my website service, how about roasting my conversion copy?
*   Self Care - this is another huge market. How many are thinking about mental wellness for remote workers who are isolated due to coronavirus, or in foreign lands alone?
*   Ethics - we're beginning to see more privacy-first products emerging, like Simple Analytics. Privacy as a unique sell will go mainstream.
*   Virtual Meets - with coronavirus, meetups will be livestreamed, or on Zoom. No one had yet cracked the remote experience of a large groups gathering virtually.
*   Indie Parents - a trend to come in the next 2 decades, once all the indie hackers start getting married and having kids. Because let's face it, nomading the world with children is an entirely different game altogether. 
*   New York City/San Francisco/London - hyperlocal is a niche in itself. Worth diving deeper into for your own town/city.
*   The Six/Seven Figure Club - mastermind groups for millionaires! Think about the spending power available from this group.
*   No-Code - what was once a minority might very well grow into the majority of indie hackers. Already valued at billions as an industry, this is a definite trend to watch.
