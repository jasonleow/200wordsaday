As Singapore heads into our most serious '[circuit breaker](https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-circuit-breaker-heightened-safe-distancing-measures-to-reduce-movement)' (our fancy PR name for "lockdown") yet tomorrow due to COVID-19, staying home and eating in will be the norm, at least for the next 4 weeks. How might we stay safe at home, yet make it more pleasant while also staying in ketosis? Being able to get our keto supplies right to my door will go some way in easing any concerns I think.  

   
So I ploughed through my [keto directory](https://ketolistsingapore.com) and curated a [collection of  links](https://ketolistsingapore.com/?Listings=stay%20home) of local keto home deliveries—meals, groceries, bakes, snacks—to keep on keto-ing even while staying home. 

  

### ? Meal plans delivery

• **Ketomei** - Singapore's first keto meal plan delivery, with local hawker favs to Western menu. Food is chilled packed, not frozen.  
• **Elyon Cafe** aka Keto Indulgence is an all-keto cafe located in Bt Merah but it also does meal plans. Food is chilled fresh.  
• **Fresher** provides an international fusion style of flash-frozen meal plans that includes dishes like cauli mac and cheese, burgers, curries.  
• **Simply LoCarb** offers frozen, ready-to-heat microwaveable meals for your Netflix nights. Check out their cauli fried rice with chicken and egg.

  

### ? Groceries

• **Carbs For Keto** is a shiny new online keto store based in Singapore offering some baking and cooking condiments and ingredients, like keto tomato sauce, keto cake mix, and konjac noodles.  
• Keto bakers will be relieved to know that **Redman by Phoon Huat** is considered an essential service! ? Finally, we have time to bake at home.  
• **Mahota Market** offers weekly subscription boxes of organic, farm-to-table veggies.

  

### ? Keto bakes & snacks

• The egg mayo 'curry' puffs from **Ange Bakes** makes for a nice keto breakfast, now that we have time for breakfast at home! They are also offering a stay-home pack now to make staying home more pleasurable.  
• **Bakening** delivers keto bread to your door, made with natural ingredients and no nasties.  
• **DJ Keto**'s mocha packet drink is basically the iced Milo that we know and loved before we went keto. Now we can relive that!  
• **Wowlah** has a starter kit of keto snacks which now can double up as a stay home care package! And guess what, they are giving away one kit for FREE – join the giveaway here.  
• Keto home bakers do home deliveries by default, so there's many to choose from the list. Check out Instagram home bakers like **@mettakaka** for swiss rolls and **@j.laperriere** for muff cakes.

  

### ? Delivery services

• If your favourite keto store doesn't do home delivery, fret not. [**Qexpress by Qoo10**](https://www.qoo10.sg/item/QXPRESS-QX-QUICK-DELIVERY-ONLY-FOR-LOCAL-DELIVERY-SINGAPORE/542378175) is cost-effective option. Otherwise, [**GrabExpress**](https://www.grab.com/sg/express/) is a safe bet.
