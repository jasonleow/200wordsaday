Yesterday, @brandonwilson asked me this question in response to a [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/writings-on-meditation-3-the-ego-172055cd830ae03e5b) I wrote about practising meditation for slightly over 10 years:  

_@jasonleow Ten years is a long time. What are the 1-2 aspects of your life that you feel have fundamentally changed over that time period that you attribute to your practice of meditation?  
_

And my reply that that:

  

_@brandonwilson wow great question but hard to answer haha. Hard because it's hard to tell where meditation starts and where everything else I did begins (as part of larger spiritual practice and daily healthy living). My best guess is mental hygiene - from little things like better sleep at night (sitting before sleep helps reset mind), calmer, grounded start to the day (from morning meditation), to bigger things like feeling more centred in life, and a sense of refuge. I think this warrants a longer post! Thanks for the inspiration hah._  

  

This question really made me think hard about how meditation had changed me over the 10 years. It was a really great question to try to break down, because there's many factors co-arising and co-influencing the changes. I feel inspired by the reflection and want to have a deeper exploration and more posts about what meditation did for me so far. Maybe I'll expand a bit more on it around these themes:

  

*   What changed? Great question, hard answer.Â 
*   Mental hygiene
*   Connection to body
*   Centredness
*   A place of refuge
*   Anything else?

  

_To be continued..._
