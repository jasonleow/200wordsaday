How does one become limitless? That question was inspired by @keni 's [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/update-224105d27f725a8a22): 

  

> I enjoy doing many different experiments. I love them. And I notice potential new experiments everywhere I look. I am also making new connections that push me to do more. The goal of all of these projects is achieving something similar. Becoming limitless. Yes exactly like in the movie.

  

I loved how she phrased her goal. How beautiful and powerful. Truth is, I'm also a big fan of the movie. The fictional drug in the movie, NZT, does not exist (yet) in real life, but there's many nootropics available on the market right now to boost your brain capacities. But what I'm really enthralled with is the idea of living out your full potential in work, health and life, even though I'm not sure about the dysfunctional dependence on drugs to do so, as depicted in the movie. 

  

If anything, just the words "I want to be limitless" already sound fiercely motivating and aspirational. It feels like something I can repeat to myself staring at the mirror. Kind of a positive self-talk thing. Belief is a powerful thing, after all. As personal North Stars go, "being limitless" feels like a great way to phrase it. But it's still kind of vague. Breaking it down into the different aspects of life, how would it look like? 

  

**_What do I need to achieve to feel limitless in wealth, health/fitness, and life/wisdom?_** 

  

I think for me, it'll be somewhere along the lines of this:

  

Being limitless in wealth means I have a mindset of abundance, and be able generate sufficient wealth in an ethical way, such that I can live out the lifestyle I want for myself and my family, as well as use it to reach my goals in other aspects in life.

  

Being limitless in health and fitness is when I'm free of ailments, feel strong when I workout everyday, and enjoy an overall powerful sense of wellbeing.

  

Being limitless in life and wisdom entails that I feel peace, happiness and purpose in my daily actions and thoughts, in every aspect of life - work, love, family, world.
