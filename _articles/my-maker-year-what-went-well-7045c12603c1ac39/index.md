_Day 10 of the #200wad challenge._  

  

Part 3 of a raw report card on my maker journey so far. An honest look at the good and the bad so far. 2018 was a maker year for me. My very first year as an indie maker. In Feb, I made a commitment to launch a minimum viable product a month (#1mvp1month). Read [Part 1](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-maker-year-in-products-made-5185c0f4273ac376) (list of products made) and [Part 2](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-maker-year-in-metrics-7065c126121b4c1c) (metrics).  

  

### What went well

✅ **Sustaining motivation for launching every month using public commitment.** There were some delays, yes. But I still managed to deliver, and am still delivering. Maintaining motivation was hard, but the single most effective tool was making a public commitment to launch a product every month. Even when there's delays, nobody reminded me or chased me for an update, but despite that, the costs to personal integrity was high enough that I willed myself through most of the time. I hate breaking promises, especially ones I made publicly.

  

✅ **Exponential learning about making and myself as a maker, by launching every month.** What I like/hate to do, what I'm good/bad at, and what I want to do more of in the future. I get a deep satisfaction from the aesthetics and visual aspect of making - I think deep down I'm still a designer at core. Enjoyed interacting with my users when they used the product and gave feedback. I'm definitely not great at building a community product like forums and chat groups - it takes a certain kind of (extroverted) personality to be good at making conversation. Throughout the whole year, I struggled with asking others for help and still struggling with it. Big thumbs-down for projects that's content-heavy with short refresh windows (like weekly posts on Public Design Jobs), as it was difficult to scale them solo. More technical learnings to come in next post.  

  

✅ **Made lots of social capital.** So many connections - locally and globally - which I would never have made had I not shared my work so publicly. My work used to be pretty niche (design+government) and local (Singapore), but now there's a global perspective to my work so that's kinda thrilling! There were even a few potential global collaboration and work opportunities.  

  

✅ **(Re)discovering meaning, passion, and what its implication to making.** Making weird/imaginary/white space/conceptual stuff like [Space Nomads](http://space-nomads.com) had been indulgently enjoyable, because 1) playing around with images of the Moon, planets, nebulae, other galaxies and outer space from NASA and SpaceX was awe-inspiring and wonder-inducing, 2) creating fiction works with the imagination and that's something I realised I missed using. Projects made out of pure passion and for fun are also much easier to maintain and keep shipping, because I enjoy and cannot help but **want** to keep work on it everyday! 

  

✅ **A no-code approach to making that's proven to work time and again**, across a wide variety of digital products: ecommerce store, content curation directories, discussion forum, chat group, job board, productized service, travel agency, chat bot. Caveat: these are MVPs. Beyond that, when there's a need to customize/pivot as a product grows based on specific user needs and feedback, I think coding will be required.   

  

✅ **Broke even.** That counts as something that went well, right? ?
