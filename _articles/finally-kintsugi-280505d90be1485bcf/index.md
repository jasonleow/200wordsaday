Finally, kintsugi!⚱️

  

After a hiatus of 5 months, finally got back to finishing my homework given by sensei [@urujyu](https://www.instagram.com/urujyu/) back in April when I went to Kyoto to learn the traditional Japanese craft of kintsugi. Life just kind of took over the past months—got too busy, too tired, or too distracted. But there’s always a nagging desire that my hands didn’t forget. That I relished working with my hands, using it in artisanal and craftsman ways. So today, I did.

  

Put on soothing music, turned on the air-conditioning, laid out my tools, opened the blinds, chimed the bells, closed the doors. A little ritual to re-create that light and airy studio where my kintsugi started. And then, two hours of meditative, quiet work. No distractions, no notifications, no conversations. Just me, hands, and kintsugi pieces. Scraping, sanding, smoothing. Holding, toying, peering at the bowls with my tools. All the while, regular bells to remind me to breathe, mindfully. At the end of the session, I emerged feeling so stable and grounded. The hands remembered. The body remembered.

  

That [tranquility](https://200wordsaday.com/words/kintsugi-mornings-138675ca348de9407c). That flow. That quiet delight.

  

Today was just the start. As part of my [#100daychallenge](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-100-day-challenge-approach-goals-275315d84d72a2d821), I hope to finish these pieces by the end of the year.? 

  

Fitting artefacts, to a year of healing and transformation.
