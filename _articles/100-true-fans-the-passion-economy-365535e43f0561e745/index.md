I'm a big fan of [Kevin Kelly's 1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) theory. The premise behind 1000 true fans is that the internet will allow indie creators to make a comfortable living with an annual income of $100k if 1000 true fans paid $100 per month for content, music, product or a SaaS. But he wrote that 2008, 11 years ago. In tech, that's dog years. The original iPhone was launched in 2007, just a year before his post. Much had changed since.

  

Now there's a new take on this theory by VC firm a16z – [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/).

  

> _The creator economy is in the midst of a decisive shift—from a “bigger is better,” ad-driven revenue model to one of niche communities and direct user-to-creator payment... For creators who earn the trust of a niche audience and who deliver what those users crave—whether self-improvement, connection, recognition, or belonging—100 True Fans provides an updated monetization model for the fast-growing_ [_Passion Economy_](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/)_._

  

The idea is this:

*   100 true fans, each giving $1000/year, or $83/month
*   Your fans are not a uniform, monolithic group. There's segments based on their willingness to pay. The top 100 are the super-fans, the ones you have the closest relationships to and deliver personalised service to. They are the high value purchasers. The next tier below are donors and patrons, while the bottom-most tier are the free audience. Kind of like a monetization funnel.
*   For someone to pay $1000, there has to be really premium, hard-to-access content. Perhaps the value or results they get back in return are multifold more than the initial investment, or the status benefit by association is extreme. Think of this like a very exclusive club. 
*   The user needs served are much higher order, like self improvement, transformation, exclusiveness. It's all part of an emerging [Passion Economy](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/), where "there are now more ways to capitalize on creativity. Users can now build audiences at scale and turn their passions into livelihoods".

  

This is exciting and inspiring to read. It ticks all the boxes for the kind of work I wish to do as an indie creator – warm relationships with more selective few customers, doing something I'm good at and passionate about, working solo for myself, having autonomy and control over my creative output, and helping people grow, transform, or improve. And most importantly, stuff that people are actually willing to pay for, instead of monetizing through sponsorships, ads or donations.

  

Lowering the bar from 1000 to 100 fans sounds really encouraging. Of course, the quality of work is raised at the same time, but that feels like an easier challenge, especially if you find something you're really good at and passionate about.

  

That's what I love most about this idea. Nobody can take your skills and passions away from you. A government or a creditor can foreclose your property, confiscate your store, hardware, or equipment, but they can't take your skills. 

  

Wherever you go, your expertise follows, as your 100 true fans. 

  

Thrive, anywhere.
