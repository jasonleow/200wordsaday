Wind, teach me not the secrets of Nature, but show me how to fly like you do. Teach me to soar the southern skies and find my guiding star. Let me cover lands in time no mortal can surpass, and allow me to see wonders no eyes ever awed upon! I wish to fly, Wind.  

  

You make you first lesson difficult, my student! Because it's easier to fly, than for you to face your mortal limits. I empathise with you, as much as I empathise with all the others who came before you. Lonely is your journey. But your wish echos in my ears and heart. For that, I shall educate you some.Â 

  

The only way to fly is to make flesh what the language of Nature is in your mind. Just as one speaks to Nature with one's heart and soul, it is with the same likeness that you shall fly when your heart and soul is one with Nature. See to fly not in any narrow, limited definition that your mortal world would have it, but soar as you would as if nothing else matters in your plain mortal existence. Fly within, and you shall find all that you seek Just......fly!

_I'm flying to Kyoto today, to learn a traditional craft called kintsugi. To learn what it means to find perfection in imperfection. To grow from (metaphorically) fixing brokenness with gold. It seems fitting to post this piece about the Wind, about flying, about soaring beyond oneself._
