I'd always heard about the toxic side of Twitter. It's like scary stories you hear of a faraway land that you had never been to. I'd been using Twitter for years, but somehow, perhaps due to the topics I follow and the people, 99% of the time, it's Tolerant Twitter. People are mostly well-mannered and civil. Disagreements yes, heated arguments, for sure. But I had not yet experienced irrational internet mobs bullying someone.

  

Today I did. And it spoiled my entire day.

  

Disclaimer: it didn't happen to me, but someone else I follow. But seeing people descend on the tweet in rage, all from just reading the headlines, had been a exercise in patience. I felt that typical bystander conflict – jump in to help at the risk of making things worse, or just walk away? 

  

Of course, the choice would be easier if it was clear that he was in the right. But it wasn't all too clear. And he didn't try to explain himself. At least not at the time of writing. So what's a bystander to do in such a situation? I could be helping the wrong guy to start with. Do I jump in and speak up before getting all the information, or do I stay calm, assess the situation and let more information unfold before doing anything?

  

In the end, I chose the easiest way to shut off toxicity: mute conversation and blocking idiots.

  

Avoidance.

  

It doesn't make the world a better place, but it does make mine better. At least my sanity's better.

  

The world's battles worth fighting are many. But not worth joining in the fray over someone else's lame status games and identity politics in tweets. 

  

\[Update:\] Nope he said didn't steal it. It just happened that the headline sounded similar. But everyone just piled on, after just reading the headlines. Typical mob outrage. Now I wished I spoken up more......
