He probably mentioned this before, but there seems to be a pattern going on for all Elon Musk's companies and products, and I'd venture a wild theory here - they are all built to get us to Mars and live there. Think about it:

  

? Most obviously, SpaceX to actually get us there.

? Neuralink's brain-machine interfaces to command spaceships and colony systems using AI-human augmentation.

☀️ SolarCity's solar roofs & Tesla Powerwalls to power the Martian grid.

? Starlink to learn and prototype ways to start a planetary level internet broadband when we start colonising Mars. 

? Bulletproof body and armoured glass of the Tesla Cybertruck to withstand the harsh conditions to explore Mars on land.

? The Boring Company and Hyperloop for underground transport and living on Mars - what better way to avoid the harsh climate on Mars than to go underground?

? Flamethrower to kill aliens - you watched the original _Aliens_ right?

? Teslaquila - to celebrate when he/we finally get there. 

  

Possible? Plausible? I think so! 

  

Talk about [making products that make us dream](https://200wordsaday.com/words/tesla-s-cybertruck-making-products-that-make-us-dream-315795dd944152da06)! Look at how he dreams and how he creates companies and products that all weave together, towards that one, defining purpose. Not even Apple comes close to this level of harmony and ambition across seemingly disparate products and industries.

  

Makes me wonder...... 

  

_What can I do to have this level of harmony in the products I make?_ 

  

_What is the one, defining goal that can thread all of them together in a cohesive narrative?_
