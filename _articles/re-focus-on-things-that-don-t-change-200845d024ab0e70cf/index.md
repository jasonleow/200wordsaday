[@seunoyebode](https://200wordsaday.com/words/focus-on-things-that-don-t-change-200305d0155379774d) just shared this [article](https://www.pulse.ng/bi/tech/jeff-bezos-says-the-true-secret-to-business-success-is-to-focus-on-the-things-that/x4m1bfq) about Jeff Bezos, where he said "the true secret to business success is to focus on the things that won't change, not the things that will."  

  

I like the phrase "things that don't change". Timeless truths are romantic to hold on to, and a good reminder when the popular reflex now seems to be always chasing the next shiny thing. It's definitely very Jeff Bezos, as he had talked extensively about long term thinking. He even funded a project called the Long Now, a 10,000-year clock deep in a mountain cave in Texas.  

  

Though I like the phrase and the concept of timelessness, I don't feel that that maxim alone is sufficient for the hard reality of running a business, or doing anything significant for that matter. The truth is, we need both isn't it? Both "What's going to change in 10 years" and "What's timeless?". We need to be agile with the tools and technology we use to deliver products, yet at the same time we need to stay timeless with a set of values and ethics. We may swing between the 2 ends of this spectrum, depending on the specific situation, context, or business activity. 

  

Why does it have to be either black _or_ white? Why not a bit of both at any one time? Or choosing one for some situations, and choosing the other for other situations?

  

To be honest, I'm sure he does that too. I'm sure the complexities of running a $800billion company is seldom as simplistic as just focusing on things that don't change. I'm guessing that's probably not his exact meaning in the interview, but just how the media chose to position the article. Everything sounds more click-worthy when it's polarised and dumbed down in black _or_ white.
