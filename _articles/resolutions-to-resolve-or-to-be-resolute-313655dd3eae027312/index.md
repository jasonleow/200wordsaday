@abrahamKim mentioned [something](https://200wordsaday.com/words/2019-resolutions-313165dd2af2c1cf36) interesting about New Year resolutions. He read "resolution" as something to _**resolve**_, to close for the year, instead of being _**resolute**_ to achieve a goal set out for the new year.

  

> _Do I misunderstand the word resolution? In stories I imagine it being the part where the climax is resolved. The ending. And yet people call their New Year's goals resolutions. Anyways I was about to write of my 2019 closing plans, when I realized that could well be described my 2019 resolutions. How will this year -- and decade btw, yeah scary i know -- resolve. Let me know how you'll be resolving yours._

  

I love that interpretation. I always read it as being resolute. But now that he mentioned it, it's really two sides of the same coin, isn't it? In a way, with New Year's Day being the center, "resolve" is in the before and "resolute" in the after. You review what went on for the year, look back with nostalgia, horror or joy, and close the chapter that is the year just past. Then you look forward to the next year and imagine, envision, and plan goals to hit, habits to break or make.

  

Nobody taught us that New Year resolutions could be seen backwards in time. Trust writers to come up with it! Fun. 

  

I already do reviews and reflections at the end of every year, but now I have no need to use those words. Just resolutions will do - resolving and resoluting. 

  

Can't wait!
