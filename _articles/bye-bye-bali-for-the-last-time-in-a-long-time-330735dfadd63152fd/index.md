It always starts with a few words. But these few words had been hard, and a long time coming. It's hard to say goodbye. As I'm writing this, tears flow. ?

  

So...it's goodbye, Bali. For the last time, in a long time. Thank you for caring for me all this while. You had been a silent witness to my healing. I think I’m done here, _for now_. I won't need to be back for some time, probably a long time, but I’ll always remember your kindness in my times of need. You were like a kind Mother to me. You housed me safe, fed me well, and gave me respite when I was all beaten and weary. Time and again, over and over, until now, I return to you for the last time, restored. And ready. Ready for the next season. 

  

For that, I'll be always grateful. Always. 

  

But healing work is never done _done_. So who knows! Maybe one day I might need your warm embrace again. But for now, I think I'm graduating. Things had certainly turned a corner. It feels significant in an intuitive way that I cannot completely put into words. But there's a certain feeling of finality to it.

  

This morning, on the morning of my final-ish departure, Mount Agung—Bali's holiest mountain and most powerful volcano—graced me with an appearance at sunrise this morning! Clear, pink skies. Gentle yet massive presence over on left of the horizon, as the sun rose on the other side. Sun salutations, but was it the Sun to Agung, or Agung to the Sun?

  

Likewise, like all goodbyes, is this "Bye! Farewell!', or "Please come back again"? 

  

Bye, Bali. For the last time. In a long time.
