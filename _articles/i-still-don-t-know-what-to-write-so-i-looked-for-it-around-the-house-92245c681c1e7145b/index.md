Slump week still ongoing. But I feel like it's getting more fun despite the slump because I have to get really creative and inventive now to 'game' it and still fulfil my 200 words a day. 

  

I still do not know what write. So I went around the house looking for it. In my book shelf. On the dining table. Under the study table. In the shoe racks. In my fridge. 

  

_Wait what?_ 

  

Yes. In the fridge. So the cheat here is this: Find 10-20 short phrases/sentences from around the house. Anywhere. On food packaging. In books. In magazines on your coffee table. On random slips of paper stashed away in some dark corner of a drawer you had not opened for years. On boxes from purchases you bought months ago. Yes, ANYTHING. 

  

Then piece these 10 phrases together in the most coherent way possible, like some sort of forced poetry. You can use some words to join them together, but keep these _italicised_ so that readers can tell the difference. So here goes:

  

...................................

  

**To the child within**

**An open letter to a new generation**

**Joy is the ultimate creator  
**

**_and for these_ treasures from the soul**

**Store in a cool dry place**

**_be it at_ home, school, office**

**_or in_ Alaska - the last frontier  
**

**You have to feel the difference _to truly know these treasures_  
**

**2 missed chances _and you'd be crying for more_**

**Think of tissue, think of us**

  

**Reading is fun, _if only we read more random stuff like that_**  

  

...................................  

  

Can you guess which sentence came from what/where?
