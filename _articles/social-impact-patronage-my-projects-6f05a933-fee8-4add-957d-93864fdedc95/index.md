Since thinking about starting my social impact patronage, I thought I can put together some data about the stuff I had done and the numbers behind each of my 11 tech for good projects.

\[Data analytics from start of app till present ~1 Mar to 29 Oct 2020:\]

### **Tools for COVID19**

sheet2site.com/s/toolsforcovid19/

Tools, resources and support for small-medium businesses to tide through COVID-19.

Total users = 784

Page views = 1.52k

### **Majulah Belanja**

Collaborated with my migrant worker NGO, COVID Migrant Worker Support Coalition, to create this community requests and offers board to grant wishes to migrant workers.

Total requests and offers = 1800+

Total requests matched = 700+

### **Visual Aid**

Sessions = 5.95k

Page views = 7.58k

### **Dabao Dash**

sheet2site.com/s/dabaodash/

A community offers and requests board to connect hawkers and small F&B operators with delivery drivers, since many F&B were affected by COVID and had to transit to delivery business model. 

Total users = 9.71k

Sessions = 12.7k

Page views = 18.8k

### **Grant Hunt**

gogranthunt.com/

A chatbot and directory to help non-profits and charities discover new grants that they never knew existed, in order to tide them through COVID-induced financial difficulty. I recently got funded by The Majurity Trust for creating a version 2 of the Grant Hunt chatbot.

Total users = 670

Sessions = 933

Page views = 1.1k

Total chatbot users = 141

### **SG Long-term Care Costs Calculator**

carecostscalculator.better.sg 

Made this in collaboration with members from Better.sg, a tech for good volunteer collective. This calculator helps people better estimate the costs of caring for a loved one for the long term. Information like this isn't always readily available.

### **Sweet Jam Sites COVID19 initiative**

sweetjamsites.com/covid-19

Sweet Jam Sites is a commercial web design service that I run, but I wanted to give back, so started this thing where I made free websites for people driving COVID-related causes. The offer also extended to building portfolio websites for creative professionals who were affected by COVID. Made 6 websites to launch so far:

covidsgsurvey.netlify.app - a NGO that does analysis of COVID-related behaviours

irr-c19-mwhelp.netlify.app - a NGO helping migrant workers in Singapore

moppyart.netlify.app - helped an illustrator build her portfolio site

callhome.sg (1 landing page, 2 documentation sites) - my proudest effort for this initiative. Call Home is a 3G-to-landline calling app that allows migrant workers to call home to their loved ones for free.

### **Public Design Vault**

publicdesignvault.com/

This was done way before COVID. A directory of 500+ tools, resources and links for social impact design. I used to have a suite of sites under the Public Design theme - a job board (Public Design Jobs), a forum (Public Design Forum), but had to put them on hiatus due to cost of maintaining and low usage. Maybe one day I will revive them when new cheaper tools emerge, or I get better at coding to run my own servers for them.
