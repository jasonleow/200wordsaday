_\[Continuing my learning in marketing and monetization since_ [_Juicy January_](https://cowriters.app/words/juicy-january-336225e0c7591b0fb8)_, here's some more marketing experiments and learning points:\]_

  

**One home page to rule them all, or multiple landing pages to bind them?**

The conventional wisdom is that you should have ONE home page for your target customers, and perfect your copy to convert them. But since learning about marketing, I discovered that marketeers would often create separate, stand-alone landing pages for their marketing campaigns for different promo deals for different target customers, where they could track the campaign's effectiveness in isolation. 

  

That got me thinking – _**what if I had multiple 'home pages' instead of just one?**_ I could just have the generic home page (e.g. sweetjamsites.com/) and branch off other personalized landing pages from that (e.g. /freelancers, /productizedservices, etc). 

  

**What's the problem?**

The problem I'm trying to solve here is that my target audience can come in different shapes and sizes – the freelancer, the agency, the productized business, and more generic service businesses. Each group has slightly different needs and SEO key words. The value proposition can be better customized to each group if there were separate landing pages. So why bind myself to just a single home page trying to write copy that would resonate to all customer groups? Oftentimes, by trying to address everyone collectively, you end up addressing no one. Because the message becomes too watered down to resonate with any one group. 

  

**No need to trade off**

In the initial stages of Sweet Jam Sites, I sought help on [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tell-me-what-my-product-does-d3a2bdc96d) forum to help me improve my website's copy. It was a lot of work iterating many times over on the copy. It got better for sure, but also become more generic. I thought it was a necessary evil, a trade-off I had to make. But with this new idea, I don't have to anymore. In fact, beyond the four groups I identified, I can easily create landing pages for even more niche customers, like for a specific job or industry, like for writers, accountants, etc. Each of the links to the landing pages can then be used to share on the respective platforms or communities.  

  

**Perhaps it's time to kill this sacred cow of web design, of having just one home page as a single source of truth.**

  

_\[Of course, this is still in the experimentation stages. Will report back on the efficacy.\]_
