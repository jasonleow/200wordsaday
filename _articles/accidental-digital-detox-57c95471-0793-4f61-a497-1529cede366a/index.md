My phone died on me a few days ago. And the past week had been an interesting period of accidental digital detox. OK not 100% detox though, because I used an old phone in the interim. But because the phone was really old, I didn't have access to or interest in downloading all my apps, so it felt like a significant dose of detox, anyhow.

It's interesting to observe my own reactions to the initial demise of the phone. Like losing a limb, the initial flurry of frustration, anxiety and denial is tell-tale of a huge dependence on the phone. It's true, the smartphone is like a cybernetic extension of ourselves now in this day and age, and losing it is like losing a limb, or part of my brain. I wanted to rush down to the repair shop to get it fixed. IMMEDIATELY. It's that critical. I wouldn't even do that if I had a flu or fell ill! Once the fact had sunk in and I come to terms that there's no reviving it, I switched to my old phone and proceeded to download the essential apps to tide me through till I get a new one. The apps that got into the list of essentials were surprising, but not surprising on second thoughts:

*   Default email app
*   Calendar
*   Chrome browser
*   Chat apps - Whatspp, Telegram
*   Podcast - Overcast

I also downloaded Facebook but didn't find enjoy it so it wasn't used much. It's great to know that in times of 'crisis', I didn't find social media as essential. The essential ones are really to keep tabs on my communication with work and family (except podcast which I wanted to listen to during my lunch walks). No entertainment, no fancy camera apps, no nothing except what a phone was originally for - _plain old communication_. I loved the experience. It's as if my life had gotten so much simpler with no effort at all. The weight of giving attention to so many tiny squares on my phone screen - **lifted!** There seems to be more capacity in the head in the ensuing days. But practically speaking, I do foresee needing other apps like my banking apps if I ever do this for a longer period. 

Here's an idea: There should be a vacation/digital detox setting on smartphones, where at the flip of a toggle button, all the apps on your phone disappear except the ones on the essential list. 

_What a great way to to use and consume the internet more mindfully, isn't it?!_
