I had a backache. It ached real bad. I really wanted the backache to go away. Doing this and that, stretching the muscles left and right, I tried to make it go away. 

  

I resisted. The backache insisted.

  

What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? They _surrender_.

  

So I did. I simply gave up. "You can be anything you want to be, Backache." I said. "You can stay. I will embrace you with tenderness instead of animosity." And with that, I loosened up. With my back muscles relaxed and loose, it felt better. The next day, I felt it healing. Every now and then, the backache made itself known. It likes to announce its presence, from time to time. But I ceased fighting it. 

  

Sometimes, anticipating or resisting pain makes it worse. I should still get some medical attention for it, definitely. Mindfulness helps but it'll be foolhardy to think that it heals everything! Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. I can refuse the [second arrow](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dont-shoot-the-second-arr_n_5102701). 

  

I was suffering due to the backache. I ached on top of the backache. But now, it's just a backache.

_How many times in the past had I instinctively fought back at the slightest discomfort? Had I tried to be mindful and embrace the discomfort with tenderness, before reacting? Many times, nothing much needs to be done. More haste, less speed._
