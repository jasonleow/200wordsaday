This is a classic about using the Pareto Principle on your work, from James Clear, author of Atomic Habits and my favourite [email newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/april-30-2020) on the internet:

  

> _How to 80/20 your work:_

> _(1) Make a list of the 10 things you spend the most time on._

> _(2) Circle the two that truly drive your results. Do more of those._

> _(3) Look at the others. Eliminate ruthlessly. Automate or outsource what you can. Press pause on the rest._

> _(4) Repeat._

  

So simple. And ruthlessly clear.Â 

  

Reading this, it gave me an idea of looking through my Trello board to to-dos for each of my projects, and to ruthlessly edit and focus. Just choose 2 that will truly drive my results, that is, my financial goals. And ignore the rest until it cannot be ignored. Outsourcing seems out of the question due to limited budget. Automation might help a bit and worth exploring.

  

This is such a timely reminder, coming at a time when I'm increasingly losing patience with myself. I had in a previous post that [enough is enough is enough](https://cowriters.app/words/don-t-build-a-product-build-a-portfolio-of-small-bets-but-until-when-403365ebaa6e28c23a). But impatience and a sense of urgency isn't enough. A good plan of action is. And thanks to Mr Clear, I am now clearer on what I need to do tomorrow:

  

Kill my to-do list. Murder on Trello.
