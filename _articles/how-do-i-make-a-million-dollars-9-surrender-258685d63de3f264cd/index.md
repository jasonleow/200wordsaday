I just came across a beautiful entry about **surrender** in [The Artist's Way Every Day: A Year of Creative Living](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Every-Day-Creative/dp/1585427470):

  

> August 19

> Allowing art to move through us without impediment means resigning as its author. The work must be allowed to author itself, to take on the shapes and colors that it prefers. I can plan a sequence, but then I must surrender to how the sequence plans itself. This is what we mean by inspiration, the willingness to surrender to the higher octave, the finer vibration that the work itself might hold. Art requires that we relinquish control. It asks us to move out on faith. In this regard, art itself is always one step ahead of the artist, calling us forward.

  

It's so serendipitous yet timely that I read this entry at this stage of my planning for my [million dollar project](https://200wordsaday.com/search?category=milliondollarquestion). Because I'd been planning so much. So much that it's beginning to feel like over-planning. When you try to enforce order in a system that's predominantly disorderly, sooner or later you'll hit a wall. Or blow up trying. 

  

To get to that $1mil goal, I'm planning and scheduling a [habit system](https://200wordsaday.com/words/how-do-i-make-a-million-dollars-7-keystone-habit-systems-251035d5566a6e5b98) that's very ordered and simple, but this system has to work through a larger, disorderly and complex system called the market, _aka life_. It depends on a lot of organic unfolding of events, people, luck, and happenstance. At some point, I can't over-think this. I can't keep holding on to top-down strategic planning, and expect things to go as I planned. I can't be beholden to thinking instead of action, plans instead of putting real products out there, being fixated and tunnel-visioned instead of being agile and opportunistic. 

  

Perhaps I got to even let go of the $1mil plan......so that I can really get on with it, towards it. 

  

**I got to surrender.** And fall...... towards it. Hopefully.
