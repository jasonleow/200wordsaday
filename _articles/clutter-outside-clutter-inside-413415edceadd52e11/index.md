So after asking what's the [biggest small thing](https://cowriters.app/words/what-is-the-biggest-small-thing-i-could-do-today-412575eda49572842d) I can do, I did it. Finally. I cleared my desk. All the clutter; receipts from weeks ago; bills paid but left lying there; books I no longer read; outdated sticky notes left flapping in the wind; things I don't need on my desk; all cleared.

  

And immediately I can feel my head clear up a bit. A bit less brain fog, a tiny bit less stressed. A little bit more breathing room, a tiny bit more clarity. So it's true. You physical space does affect your mental space. Clutter outside, clutter inside. Clean your desk, clean your mind.Â 

  

And the strange thing is, right after clearing up my desk, I started to feel tired. That kind of all systems stop kind of tired. Like finally crossing the finish line of a real 42km marathon without not another breath to spare kind of stop. It's like the body finally stops, and demands a break. Now. No matter what.

  

Clearing up my work desk which is so identified with my work, cleared up space for other things. Unhinging the habits from the past three months of coping, surviving, grasping. And now, the body feels safe again. To finally rest.

  

As without, so within.
