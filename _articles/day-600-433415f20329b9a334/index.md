I'd never done something this intentionally for so long. Not in such an unbroken fashion, at least. But after 600 days of daily writing, some thoughts:

  

Just when you thought you found your style, it changes. Either you changed, or the world changed it for you (\*erhem, COVID). There is _no_ style.

Just when you think you found something that you can't get enough of writing about, it goes away. For me, it was writing about my travels, retrospectively or in the moment. I wrote crazy loads about it last year. But now, not a single word. There is no such thing as being known for writing about one thing. Write long enough, and the thing changes, with you.

You know those personal hygiene habits that you don't even need to think to get it done? Like say, brushing your teeth, half asleep. Or showering. For writing, it really can get to a point where you're writing half asleep and you punch it out anyway. With a newborn in the house, trust me, I know.

When in doubt, write. @andrewtsao coined this recently, and it resonated. Throughout the pandemic crisis, writing was one of the key tools to help me get me through the days, weeks, months. Feeling confused, lost? Write, and be found. Feeling inspired? Write, to build on it. Feeling 'meh'? Write, to shake it off.

At some point this streak will end. Maybe at Day 1000. Feels like a nice number to finish. But that also feels as meaningful as saying, I forgot to brush my teeth this morning while rushing out to work. Most of us just brush again the next morning.

  

Day 600.
