Hard to imagine, that you are here for 100 days already. It's still surreal that you are here, with us. 

  

And you really took your time, didn't you, little one? We patiently waited, and all the while, momma stayed strong, kept going, despite the pain. All because we wanted you to arrive at your own time, own pace. We didn't want you to be rushed into the world, under bright lights in the hands of strangers all masked and gowned up. We wanted a gentle birth. Calm, hushed, under dimmed orange lights, in worship of the special moment. So you were born at home, where you will feel safest and surest. 

  

And after 31 hours, you arrived! All the blood, sweat and tears. All the sleepless nights leading up to this day. All the nurturing support from our tribe of birth women. All the steps we took as we danced with you through your nine months of metamorphosis. All, paving the way for your gentle transition into our world. 

  

And that knowing look you gave us within that first minute of seeing us, was just the assurance we needed. That all was worthwhile. And all was good.

  

Welcome, my boy.
