It's monthly goals time. I'm going to keep it simple for December. It is, after all, the end of the year. And the decade. What better opportunity to just simply...retreat _deep_ into reflection and restoration. Getting to the required depth to find the real treasures. That's why - _Deep_ December.

  

No deadlines.

No specific plans.

No hustling.

  

Just going deep into my metaphorical cave.

  

As I had done last year, I'm going on a 2-week personal retreat in Ubud, Bali (again!) to take stock of 2019. Will scoot around to take in the wind, take restful walks in rice fields, look back at the things I made and words I wrote. Resolve any lingering issues the past year, and get resolute on what I need to do next year. It's lovely to go back to one same place every year, to a place that inspires you to reflect and rest, to come full circle and see how far you've traveled, and also how much more you can go.

  

But in between the retreat, and the festivities of Christmas and New Year's Day, I would love to get back on track with the lessons from [Play October](https://200wordsaday.com/words/play-october-wrap-up-sparking-joy-in-work-301995dbbff3614d37), about following my energy and curiosity, avoiding artificial deadlines, injecting play and sparking joy in my work. That was a special month. I felt like I was on to something important, a little flower bud just opening and unfolding that tiny little bit - I actually felt joy waking up in the morning to get back to work. Joy, excitement, enthusiasm. Not anxiety, stress, or frustration. I felt that towards the last few days of October, and then November came with it's crazy whirlwind plans. That little spark of October, revealed a tiny glimpse of what flow was like, what was possible when one flows with oneself and the world. I want to keep learning how I can keep that tiny flame alive, and to grow it stronger. I see now that that's not something to be done with within a month, so I'm committed to this apprenticeship for this month on, moving into the next year.

  

So... Retreat. Reflect. Rest. Rekindle.
