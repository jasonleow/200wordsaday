Someday, sometime in the future, I will stop writing here in this platform. Nothing lasts forever. Life circumstances change. Priorities evolve. Seasons end. 

  

Don't get me wrong - my journey here hasn't ended......yet. I still want to write. The streak motivates me to keep going. And the occasional comments I get are also encouraging. But just today, I got to thinking about the future, and how one day I will eventually stop. We all will. Eventually.

  

One day, I won't have to look for interesting ideas during the day anymore. One day, I won't have to keep checking the clock at night knowing that my window is closing. One day, I won't be opening the site in anticipation to read the cool stuff people are posting. One day, I won't have to look forward to the comments I might get. One day, I won't be able to read back in wonder at all the stuff I wrote (_Wow did I really write that?!_). One day, I will look back at this time when I shared so much with such openness and honesty. One day, I will miss having the opportunity to reflect and put shapeless thoughts and feelings, into tangible prose and imagery.

  

One day, when I stop writing 200 words a day, all these things will end. 

  

When I imagine that moment in the future, it filled my heart with pangs of longing. What a shame, I thought. It was a good time. A great season of life. 

  

Saying that out loud, made me all the more appreciate what I am doing here, what _we_ are all doing here. It made be grateful. And made me want to write just another day. And another after that. And another.
