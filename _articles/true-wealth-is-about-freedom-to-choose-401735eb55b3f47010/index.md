Saw this on [James Clear's newsletter today](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/may-7-2020):

  

> _Wealth is the power to choose._

> _Financial wealth is the power to choose how to spend money._

> _Social wealth is the power to choose who to hang out with._

> _Time wealth is the power to choose how to spend your day._

> _Mental wealth is the power to choose how to spend your attention._

  

I love how he laid it out. This reminded me of the same learning I got from _The Millionaire Fastlane_ book regarding financial wealth, but James Clear here extends it to other forms of wealth too. It's eerily similar to the 8 forms of capital framework that I love to use for my annual reflections - financial, social, cultural, living, material, intellectual, experiential, spiritual. 

  

So if wealth is more about freedom, autonomy and choice instead of possessions and a number in the bank account, then how would that look like in the 8 forms of capital (or wealth)? Here's my interpretation (while borrowing some from James Clear):

  

? Financial wealth is power to choose how you want to earn money.

? Social wealth is the power to choose who you want in your life.

? Cultural wealth is the power to choose which culture you identify with, even if you're not born into it.

? Living wealth is the power to choose living close to nature.

? Material wealth is the power to choose to live with less. 

? Intellectual wealth is the power to choose ideas without being dogmatic.

?? Experiential wealth is the power to choose wisely based on lessons learnt from the past.

? Spiritual wealth is the power to choose, even when without choice.
