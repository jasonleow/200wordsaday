The Buddha is as the Buddha does. He was born, he got enlightened, he taught, he died. But he never left, really. Where did he go?

  

In the ashes that fertilized the earth.

In the rain clouds that brought us rivers.

In the tea and rice that the river and earth had grown.

In the healthy body that rice and tea sustained.

In the healthy minds that are blessed to practice.

In the temples and traditions that we have passed on.

  

No, he never really left. There's only transformation and continuation. No birth, no death.

  

When you light a candle using another lighted candle, is it the same flame in the second candle? Or a different one? 

  

His light never left. His candle burns brightly as ever. We are all continuations, in some way, whether we realise or not. This was not a club I signed up for, one could say. But perception is not requisite for participation it seems. And so it is for life itself. We never signed up for any of it, but here we are anyway, making the best of it, living it out to  end.

  

Since we're here anyway, try sharing a bit of that light along the way. It's hard, but try it anyway. With bright light brings shadows. But I believe you'll find, it's worth every tiny bit of effort. 

  

Happy [Vesak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak), everyone.
