The latest question posed by [James Clear in his newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/september-3-2020).

  

> _What are the 1-2 things that if you get them done today, you'll go to bed content?_ 

  

For some reason, that question works really well for my daily productivity. I start my day having a rough idea of the things I want to accomplish for the day. And I do get really antsy and uncomfortable if I don't finish them by the end of the day. Like the day is incomplete and wasted.Â 

  

The problem is I'm often greedy when it comes to my productivity. When I try to get too much done too often, too many days in a row end up being incomplete. And that stresses me out. As you can see, I am my own worst enemy. My good days and bad days are often my own doing (and undoing).

  

So what can I do?

  

Just follow Mr Clear's prescription. **Just 1-2 things per day**. Nothing that wouldn't fit on a 3" x 3" Post-it note when writing with a Sharpie marker pen. Just 1-2 things for the feeling of relief and achievement, that I had a productive day. That I had earned my wages, and can go to bed feeling contented, satisfied and relaxed. Anything else I accomplish beyond the 1-2 things is a bonus for even sweeter dreams.

  

_So what will you get done today/tomorrow that'll make you go to bed content?_
