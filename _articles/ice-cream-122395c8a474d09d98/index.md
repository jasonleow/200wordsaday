_I still don't know what to write, so I'm randomly choosing an emoji a day and writing 200 words about it. Another one of my writing slump cheats. Today's emoji is_ ?

  

I love ice cream so much. 

  

I love ice cream so much, I once finished a Swensen's Earthquake by myself. That's 8 scoops in one sitting, my friend. With whipped cream and chocolate, strawberry, caramel sauces. And cherries and other toppings. All by myself. I had to stop for a while several times during that sitting, because my tongue went numb with cold and I couldn't taste the ice cream. It'll be such a shame if you finished 8 scoops without tasting any of it, isn't it? I also learned that it's a good tactic to order a mix of ice-y sorbets and creamy diary ice creams, so that you can switch around to refresh your palette. My tummy didn't do so well after that, but it was so worth it.

  

I love ice cream so much, I could finish an entire pint of Ben & Jerry's in one sitting. Among my favourite B&J flavours are Cherry Garcia, Chunky Monkey and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But the all-time favourite has got to be Sweet Cookies & Cream, which had since been discontinued. Can you imagine my anguish when they stopped production on Sweet Cookies?! I went around hunting for it all over Singapore to find what stock that was remaining. Eventually it ran out everywhere, and I messaged B&J Singapore to register my displeasure. I even emailed B&J in the US if they could ship that flavour over. Nope. Saddest days of my life. Like ice cream break-up. 

  

I love ice cream so much. Ice cream is my first love. Always.
