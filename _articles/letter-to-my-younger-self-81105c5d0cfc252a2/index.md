To my younger self,

  

People often write letters to their younger self to express regrets and missed opportunities. "What would you change if you could go back?" they asked. But this is not what this letter is about. Far from it. Contrary to it, in fact. 

  

Thing is, you are exactly where you need to be, doing exactly what you need to do at your moment in life, in order to get to where I am right now. 

  

Nothing needs to change. Ever.

  

Because there's nothing I regretted doing back then. Even the stuff that were wrong, sad, or unethical. Because every heartbreak, every mistake, every failure were the stepping stones to the person that I am today. That's not to say that those wrongs were right, nor am I perfect, nor am I contented and happy with where I am today. There's still loads to do, much to grow, stuff to change. But I take on these tasks with optimism looking forward, not regretfully backwards. I learned from my past to move on from it. Even when I didn't learn from it, life makes sure things keep coming back until I do. So even not learning and growing was part of the journey. 

  

Should I write to my older self then? No. I tried writing about it, but nothing came up too. The present moment is all that matters. Learn well from the past, live well in the present, and the future takes care of itself when it arrives in the present. 

  

I suspect you already know this.

  

In fact, you don't even need to read this letter. I didn't even need to write this letter, other than to clock my 200 words a day, on this interesting writing platform from the future.

  

Onward.
