I’d been meaning to do something to help other self-employed or freelance creatives affected by lockdown measures, but wasn’t sure how my skills can help. But seeing how many others are taking time to learn new skills, study online courses and refreshing their portfolios, I realised I can help by building portfolio sites for creatives who don’t already have one and need one. 

  

Having a portfolio site is like having your resume online, plus some. It makes it easy for people looking to hire have a good overview of your experience, because a portfolio's most defining content is your past work. LinkedIn profiles, personal bio sites don't really cut it, because it's not enough to see that you did these projects, but _**how**_ you did it, your approach, the thought process behind it. And I dare say, portfolios aren't just for creative professionals like designers. Writers can also have one to show their copywriting projects. Marketing folks can show their social media campaigns they did, and the traffic it brought. Engineers can show how they troubleshoot and problem-solve various parts of the manufacturing machining process. In fact, the more typically 'un-creative' your profession seems to be, the more you should have a portfolio, because you'll stand out!

  

So here’s it: I’ll build you a simple portfolio website for you, for free. Yes, FREE. You provide the content and copy, I set up the portfolio site for you. No custom domain though - the domain of your site will be something like yourportfoliosite.netlify.app. I will use this [template for portfolio site](https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/exto/).

  

So do let me know in the comments if you want a portfolio site! Or forward this to a friend you know who might benefit from this. ?? Happy to help!
