The mournful lament of the reed flute.

The void within aching for reunion.

The soul's sorrow at being parted from the beloved Divine.

What deep longing, borne of a great lament we cannot not know...  

  

Everyday by the river, we sing our songs of devotion.

So sing your songs to the mountains, sing your songs to the sea.

Sing as if we'd never sang, live as if we'd never lived.

Sing your siren song of the soul, and soar. 

  

I never knew such depths of my heart for the Divine. Being here in Rishikesh, being by the Ganga everyday, being with devotees every evening, simply opened up gates upon gates of emotions, of deep devotion, of utter helplessness in Her, of child-like longing for Her embrace...In this last week, I'm swimming in circles around the sweet, warm waters of the Divine. As here, so elsewhere.

  

> I live my life in widening circles  
> that reach out across the world.  
> I may not complete this last one  
> but I give myself to it.  
>   
> I circle around God, around the primordial tower.  
> I’ve been circling for thousands of years  
> and I still don’t know: am I a falcon,  
> a storm, or a great song?  
>   
>  ~ Widening Circles by Rainer Maria Rilke
