_Lately, I'd been feeling the need to be more active and move more, for health. But with work, it's so hard. And not moving is killing us all. What gives?_

  

If you're using this platform, or reading it, it's likely that you do most of your work on the computer. That means sitting down all day, with hardly any movement. Sure, there's the occasional break for toilet or coffee. But mostly, we're sedentary. And that's wreaking havoc on our health. Research shows even having regular workouts don't help our health and longevity if we are sedentary most of the day. Not even standing desks will help, nor getting up from your desk every hour. It's not about sitting vs standing - it's about moving vs not moving, all through the day. A daily life where you naturally move about often had been shown to be more effective in helping us stay healthy than all the regular workouts and standing desks we have. 

  

So we got to move about more. But our jobs chain us to our desks, in front of our computers. What gives then? 

  

Quit? Change profession?

  

I'm asking myself this question more and more these days. Problem is, I love working on the computer+internet. It's such a great "bicycle for the mind". I love making digital products, and love the wellspring of knowledge and general all-round usefulness it gives. But it's killing me. After a health scare last year, my physical health became more treasured than ever. Without health, I can't do anything else...even making.  

  

_**How might we be be more active, even while we love and want to work on the computer?**_

  

I have no answers. So I'm just leaving this here. **Any ideas, guys?**
