What's a micro-SaaS? I talked about it in my post yesterday, but didn't elaborate much. Here's one trend-setting [tweet](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/893214998477983745?s=20) in 2017 by @levelsio:

  

> _Here's a new trend: fast food-type web apps. They're single feature apps that do one thing, charge $ quickly and give instant gratification.  
>   
> They have some characteristics:  
> \- tiny  
> \- single feature  
> \- no sign up  
> \- fast user flow (<1 min)  
> \- low price  
> \- charge $ quickly_

  

> _They grew out of the MVP trend, but we realized it's not just us who like minimal, users like it too. No giant app with 100 features. A tiny app with 1 feature for one flat price. As a dev (or studio) you need about 10 of these (at $1,000/m-$5,000/m) to make a solid income ($10,000/m-$50,000/m). Homework exercise: think of something that you can charge $1-$5 for a single feature web app, that's easily shareable and can go viral._ 

  

> _"i really love this trend — it makes websites feel like vending machines, in a good way."_

  

> _"Examples of fast-food apps: go to fiverr or ifttt and explore those small gigs/jobs which have users. E.g your resume as an infographics etc"_

  

I love the entire thread. A treasure throve of ideas and inspiration for micro-SaaS. I love the idea of a single feature app, easy to code, and low bar to purchase. On top of that, single feature means less support needed, and less maintenance too. To be honest, making a full-featured SaaS feels daunting for me now, so breaking down the learning journey into smaller steps like this makes it more approachable. 

  

Since he gave homework, I thought a little brainstorm would be fun:

  

*   Mindful work bell timer
*   Google Analytics counter widget to show just page views / users
*   Collections for Twitter bookmarks
*   Nocode tool to create simple Chrome extensions that show content
*   Nagging web app to email/sms/message you multiple times per day until you complete the task
*   Embeddable blog that works on Carrd
*   Embeddable calendars on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable news tickers or banners on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable polls on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable upload form on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable sliders on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable maps on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Embeddable floating buy/subscribe buttons on Carrd/JAMstack
*   Convert PDF to fillable PDF
*   Convert PDF to Excel/Word
*   Convert Excel calculator into web app/page

  

_What else? Any ideas for a single-feature web app that will help you?_
