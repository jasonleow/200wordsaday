Inspired by [@basilesamel 's post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/places-where-i-lived-207475d0cc08dddfbb), here's my own note to self of the places I had been to. Not necessarily having lived there for one month, just cities and countries I traveled to before.   

  

**Asia**

Malaysia ?? 

Thailand ??

Vietnam ??

Indonesia ??

Myanmar ??

Hong Kong ?? / China ??

Japan ??

Philippines ??  

India ??

Bhutan ??

Singapore ??

  

**Europe**

England ???????

Germany ??

Czechia ??

France ??

Belgium ??

Netherlands ??

Switzerland ??

Sweden ??

Denmark ??

Finland ??

Norway ?? ??

Iceland

  

**North America**

USA ??

Canada ??

  

**South America**

**Africa**

**Oceania**

**Antartica**

**Moon**

**Mars**

  

Why am I doing this? To know where I had been, so that I can better see where I can go next. I enjoy looking forward to doing something new, and travel is one of those.

  

I'd done lots of Asia and Europe, and though I love it there, maybe I can start looking elsewhere now. I can definitely do more North America! Lots of lovely cities in USA and Canada that I want to go to, and to check out the Mayan ruins in Mexico. Oceania is close by, so it's unbelievable that I had not yet stepped on the continent ever. No excuses now. Africa feels like a far and foreign place, but the savannahs and safaris have crossed my mind before. And South America! Such a huge place but strangely I'd not be drawn there...yet. I wonder if it will ever get cheap/easy enough to visit Antartica. Being from the tropics, I'm not a fan of extreme cold, so I'm not so sure about that. Finally, the Moon and Mars. Can Elon Musk finally make commercial space travel accessible to the masses? The first private space flight to Mars might happen in my lifetime, but I doubt it'll get _cheap enough_ within my lifetime. Till then, one can dream, like this little side project I made last year -  a [fictional space travel tour agency for the masses](https://space-nomads.com/).

  

Wow, so many new places to look into, so little time!
