?? Noob developer question: Looking for tutorial-style blog posts or articles on how to create a website builder from scratch (in the likes of Carrd, Squarespace, or even Sheet2site) - anyone came across any? 

  

Basically the usual things that such platforms can do:

\- users can authenticate and create accounts

\- in their accounts they can select templates or web elements/blocks for their site, edit copy, upload images

\- publish their site to a subdomain

\- pay for monthly subscription for custom domain, analytics, adding payment gateways, etc

\- users can create websites that in themselves allow for authentication and account creation for their own end-users, probably for access to gated content

  

I'd been interested in **static websites** for some time – the combination of fast load times, minimal attack surface, and adding APIs for extra functionality is attractive to me. So the tech stack could be using the usual HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP, or Ruby on Rails and/or Jekyll, or React/Gatsby. 

  

I'd been wanting to build a website builder on my own for learning and potentially as a side hustle, but just need a bit of reference on how to start. Amazingly, googling "how to build a website builder" didn't return much! It's such a potentially huge project to take on alone, that I don't even know how to break it down and where to start looking for specific help.

The first part of any coding project is always about knowing how to break it down into chunks, then smaller parts, then atoms. Because only when you break it down sufficiently can you start asking the right technical questions.

  

When I asked "How to build a website builder", many had pointed out that that's too vague and broad. Developers don't really ask questions like that haha. Trust a noob to do that. Such questions will get deleted on Stack Overflow, in fact. But I needed to ask such an innocent and naive question, because I don't even know where to start. I don't even know which language I should use, because I'm open to whichever is more expedient. But now I have a better sense after seeking advice on Twitter, Indie Hackers and Makerlog. Better questions like:

  

"How to authenticate in a web app"

"JavaScript library for WYSIWYG HTML editing "

"HTML template library"

"Rails: What data models do you need for such a project"

"Create action in controller that stores user input as variables, then render pages with base template"

 "User save his preferences as parameters in frontend, populate template with the data on backend"

"Start a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline to deploy the site"

"Add DNS or CNAME record to point their domain to my subdomain"

  

Over and over again, I find programming is about knowing the right question to ask, using the right terms. Because when you can do that, you already have half the answer in your hand (because then you can google for it specifically, and ask for specific advice from others!).

  

It's a bit like using a foreign language. You might not be able to form a grammatically correct sentence, but if you know the right words to use and string them together, a local would be able to make it out somehow what you're hinting at and point you to the right direction. That's right. I'm a noob in coding foreign land, asking experienced locals (developers) how to get to my destination (building my website builder). 

  

Does that compute?
