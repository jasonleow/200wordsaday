I just read [Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Millionaire-Mind-Mastering-Wealth/dp/0060763280), by T.Harv Eker. With a lot of wealth books, it tends to hover around mindsets. But this book has a good balance of both. I found the practical tips helpful in helping me think about what [keystone money habits](https://200wordsaday.com/words/how-do-i-make-a-million-dollars-keystone-habit-systems-part-2-340375e1337f6ea3e7) I need to have.

  

Sharing them here as reference for myself, and for anyone who might find it useful. This is not a book review, just raw notes lifted directly from the book, with some minor edits, interpretations and categorisations of my own.

### **Track your net worth**

Make it a policy to know your net worth to the penny. Do this exercise:

  

Take a blank sheet of paper and title it "Net Worth". Then create a simple chart that begins with zero and ends with whatever your net worth objective is. Create a net worth statement. To do this, add the current dollar value of everything you own (your assets) and subtract the total value of everything you owe (your liabilities). Note your current net worth as it is today. Then every 90 days, enter your new net worth. That's it. If you do this, you will find yourself getting richer and richer. Why? By tracking your net worth, you are focusing on it, and because what you focus on expands, your net worth will expand. By the way, this law of focus goes for every other part of your life: what you track increases.

  

_**Remember: what you focus on expands. Where attention goes, energy flows and results show.**_

  

_**What gets measured gets done.**_

  

_To be continued..._
