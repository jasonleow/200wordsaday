This slump cheat is called Writing Scrabble. Just like how you collect letters to form words in the game Scrabble, you select a bunch of 10-20 words randomly from the dictionary, and try to make something up using some or all of those words.

  

You can string it up into a short story, like how as kids we did those "Complete the sentence..." homework. Or it can be pieced into a poem, or a free verse. I quite like the idea of using random words to 'jester', by writing poems that read like it links up but are actually completely nonsensical, or up to how the reader interprets it.

  

Here's the 20 words I picked:

  

> affinity, comfortably, opinionated, jigsaw, acrobat, pressing, opponent, urgency, minimize, off, lead, hearing, keeper, secular, continue, sneeze, infant, discount, flashback, dolphin 

  

Here goes! Selected words in **bold**:

  

                                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

What a **keeper**! What **affinity**! 

To have your **opponent pressing** you with **urgency**

like an **infant** crying out for a **dolphin**   

no matter how **opinionated** he might be, 

**Continue** walking on **comfortably**,

as an **acrobat** would walking on tightrope

while piecing a **jigsaw** bought in **discount** store.

Even if he **sneeze**,

**hearing** that, bless him quietly, 

in a **secular** way

**Minimize** contact, turn **off** all exchanges

Else it will **lead**

to a weird **flashback** once more.
