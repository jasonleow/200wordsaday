I just went to Bali with my wife for a short couple get-away. This time, we stayed at an Airbnb [shophouse apartment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B46a_TQneuP/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) right smack in town, in Ubud central. And boy did we discover a diamond in the rough. 

  

It's fascinating how our external environment shape our moods and feelings. I'd stayed in many rooms and even villas in Bali, but few had been this uplifting and inspiring, yet relaxing at the same time. This time, this apartment is just a small one bedroom with a living room and a balcony facing the street. Nothing fancy, but the decor is well thought through. Ethno-tribal influences with lots of masks, dried grass tassels, and black cat figures. Somewhat African-esque, or even, like Wakanda. Many paintings peppered throughout the apartment, lending it a more refined mood, like an artist's home. An open air bath under the stars, and high ceilings with lots of daylight brings the outside into the apartment without feeling too exposed. Ubud's best coffee is just steps away, and right beside the apartment is the village temple. Lots of street life going on around the place. Yet if we ever felt like the hustle and bustle was too much, the kitchen had everything we needed. The best part was the balcony. Close enough to the street to be able to watch Balinese village life go by, yet up high above on the second floor to feel discreet and invisible. The perfect [flâneur](https://200wordsaday.com/words/flnerie-313635dd3e6b67a022)'s apartment. I spent many a quiet moment having a drink, while looking down both ends of the street, just soaking it in without feeling like I need to partake in it. With the work table is right next to the balcony, nights writing on my laptop keep the street vibe close by, slowly seeping me in an unknown, mysterious energy that streets by night proffer. Twice a week, the neighbouring temple conducts a traditional _kechak_ ritual, and the prayers and drums fill up the home with even more magic. 

  

An artist’s home, a writer’s muse. A balcony overlooking the street, a bath under the stars. A kitchen with everything, a bedroom with light and air. A place next to the best coffee in town, a space beside a sacred temple. Everything one needs - body, mind & soul - in one place.
