_So I'm still in a writing slump. Still don't know what to write! Let's play games instead!_

  

Every played the game Charades in real life? The rule is that your team mates have to guess what a secret word or phrase is via hints that you act out or say with words and phrases that avoids using the actual word itself. 

  

So let's play a game of writing charades, in 200 words. Guess what this is. Clue: it's an action.

It's not everyday that you do this, perhaps. Some do, most don't. Once you're out and off, the wind is in your hair, blood warming through your veins, the breath you forgotten about from too many long hours of sitting down, now catches you in the chest. You like how it brings you to places you might not have been, but that's not often. Mostly, you might stick to the path most travelled. Safe, predictable, and just enough for you. Sometimes you might do this with a whole bunch of people, but most days, it's a solo event. Many have a love-hate relationship with it. For those who hate it more than you love it, more sleep for you. For those who love it more, you'll be blessed with wealth beyond compare.  

  

So now, what am I?
