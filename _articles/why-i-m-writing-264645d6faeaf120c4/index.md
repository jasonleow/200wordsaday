**Why I wrote** [**then**](https://200wordsaday.com/words/hello-world-1215c024b6bef0dc)**, back in Dec 2018 when 200wad started:**

*   always wanted to write more regularly, but never did due to perceived high barrier and expectations of upkeeping a blog
*   think by writing - it helps me reflect better about life
*   being an introvert, connecting with others through the written word is easier
*   one-directional brain-dump of what's in my head out into the world 
*   overall, **writing for convergence**, analysis, making sense, recording-keeping

  

**Why I write when I was going through a** [**writing slump**](https://200wordsaday.com/words/cheating-the-writing-slump-89385c657a18d65da) **sometime around day 60-100:**

*   just for keeping the streak
*   to do random experiments for fun (like [emoji writing](https://200wordsaday.com/words/coffee-113605c7e729b18994)) and trickstering (like creating [graphics with letters](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-still-don-t-know-what-to-write-a-word-pixel-graphic-100385c6eb57c4f324))
*   thankfully, it was a trip to [Kyoto](https://200wordsaday.com/words/kyoto-for-inspiration-130025c9634f896078) that brought new fresh energy back to my writing
*   overall, **writing for emergence**, to try to discover a new reason(s)

  

**Why I write now, after 271?:**

*   envision, imagine and plan out new [dreams](https://200wordsaday.com/search?category=milliondollarquestion) and stories I want to manifest
*   build on the comments/[discussions](https://200wordsaday.com/words/singular-september-263275d6d1e4da5cd5) with others regarding whatever I'm writing about, and therefore improve on the ideas
*   more bi-directional exchanges of soul toying with the bread dough of ideas consumed elsewhere (from books, blogs, podcasts, others' posts here), kneading it into words with shape and form, and then cannibalizing it again to sculpt it anew
*   overall, **writing for divergence**, synthesis, creating anew, future-casting  

  

It's been an interesting evolution for sure. I wonder how things will unfold in the months to come!
