OK, so [July](https://cowriters.app/words/july-wrap-up-acknowledgement-not-encouragement-434815f2576ba598fe) had been promising. So let's build on that, ride the wave and try to peak back up again! It's going to be an **Awesome August!** Here's the stuff that I need to **sustain, start** and **stop**:

  

### **? Sustain and keep going**

*   Daily code - 1h of code every day to keep the momentum going for learning towards my SaaS product
*   Sleeping early, by 1130pm, i.e. laptop shutdown by 1030pm, shower by 11pm
*   Dedicated days for different products
*   Marketing experiments for my products
*   Strict keto and 16:8 intermittent fasting, plus nightly cold showers, till hit ideal weight of 66-67kg (current 68+kg).

  

### **? Start anew**

*   **Fitness:** Start running and working out again. I'm beginning to thirst for running. There's been a 5 month hiatus so far, and the body remembers the sensation of a good workout. So this month, I'm going to start slow and put in at least 1 run per week, just for starters to see how I feel. 
*   **Inspiration:** Re-start reading and podcasts again. The quality of my thoughts and ideas is positively correlated to the quality of my consumption. Snacking on Facebook posts and Twitter tweets isn't really cutting it. I believe longer form content will help more. Podcasts used to be easy to consume as I could plug in during my commutes, but I don't commute now, so I have to find a different way to do that. Perhaps I can do so during the walk to lunch and back, and during lunch itself.
*   **Money:** Conduct monthly spending review with wife. Find ways to lower costs. Find more gigs - Fiverr, Toptal, Carousel. Apply for grants to get paid projects (use my grant directory!), e.g. Good Design Research grant. Start my daily $2 note jar ritual. Those big dreams – re-open my black book and re-start the $1mil moonshot dream – there's still 150 days to reaching it, so just try (no matter how impossible it seems)! 

  

### **? Stop - stuff I should stop doing**

*   Working without breaks/rest – take 20/20/20 breaks during the day, and remember to take rest days (doesn't have to be on the weekend)! Rest days can be a planned activity – plan 1 weekday each week for rest. 
*   Avoid PUFAs to reduce overall inflammation. No fried chicken! 
*   Sleep more and early, as I still stay up on some days just mindlessly scrolling the phone. Chronic rest/sleep deprivation means hyperinsulinemia and inflammation.

  

_Also, it's been exactly a year since I started with alliterative monthly goals. Tomorrow, a recap of this habit and goal-setting system._
