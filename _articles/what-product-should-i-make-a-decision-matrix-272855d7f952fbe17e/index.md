Early this year in January, I started out on my [#decodingcoding](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/jasonleow/collections/135c32f17d2fdcb) journey to learn programming from ground zero. I made a [list of coding project ideas](https://200wordsaday.com/words/decoding-coding-my-coding-project-ideas-24405c2f1f59178fd) then, more out of imagination than any tangible sense whether I can really make them:

  

*   **Can't Wait** - personal profile with a countdown timer against a huge, beautiful image of your travel destination, similar to [countdownto.xyz](https://countdownto.xyz/) (which had since been shut down). 
*   **Lifelist** - a mashup of WIP/Makerlog, Year Progress but for lifegoals. A task log for setting goals at beginning of year, tracking progress and showing some stats/streaks, in order to live a more intentional life.
*   **Nagnag**, a task reminder Telegram bot, like the [Nagger iOS app](https://jackm.co.uk/nagger/), which sends you a notification every X number of minutes for Y number of times.
*   **NomadFamily** - Nomadlist but for families. A list site with the resources for family-friendly cities, with the right healthcare, family care, education and social arrangements for children.
*   **Public Design Jobs 2.0**, a job board for designers in government, with automated web scraper and posting. 
*   **#1mvp1month 2.0** - automating some of the products that I made last year on [#1mvp1month](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-maker-year-in-products-made-5185c0f4273ac376) (just a dumb rephrasing of the 12 startups in 12 months challenge), and relaunching them.

  

Now, I'm at the stage where I can actually start on making something on the list. _But how do I decide which one gets made?_ I used a [flowery decision Venn diagram](https://jasonleow.sg/310/1mvp1month/) last year during the 12in12 challenge that has 4 factors of consideration - user desirability, business viability, tech feasibility, and maker enjoyability. But that felt too complex on hindsight. I want something simpler this time. So I'm going with just 2 criteria:

  

*   **Enjoyability**: Something I love making especially for myself, to scratch my own itch and hopefully others like me
*   **Profitability**: Something monetizable 

  

So there are 4 permutations of these 2 criteria:

  

*   Enjoy, AND highly monetizable - _"This is the perfect space to be in!"_
*   Meh, and highly monetizable - _"Okay, can do...as a cash cow?"_
*   Enjoy, BUT not so monetizable - _"For the fun of it..."_
*   Meh, but not so monetizable - _"Erhm hmmm..."_

  

I brainstormed some more new ideas recently and also borrowed ideas from the original January list. So I'm just going to make them and launch and see what sticks. Of course, whether it's monetizable or not is still hard to tell at this stage. My categorisations below are guesstimates at best...

  

*   **Enjoy, AND highly monetizable -**  
    **Your Life In Months** (renamed from Lifelist), with some sort of a countdown timer idea for upcoming personal events/projects (like Can't Wait). A few of us had been setting and sharing our monthly goals here on 200wad, like [Awesome August](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-awesome-august-wrap-up-262425d6b7a7f28765), so am excited to see if this would help with that.

  

*   **Meh, and highly monetizable -**  
    A **one-page landing page productized service** (need to niche this further, maybe specifically for events, concerts, micro-ecommerce or something...). I'm still keen to try building an automated productized service business. Services required lots of support time, which I'm trying to avoid in my new products, but I'm interested to see how processes can be automated and streamlined so that I can mostly manage on my own.

  

*   **Enjoy, BUT not so monetizable -**  
    Some **micro-SaaS/product**, like [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/), [Progress Bar OSX](https://www.progressbarosx.com/), or [PixelSnap](https://getpixelsnap.com/). I love the simplicity and clarity of these nifty little tools, and from my rookie's journey of learning coding, I feel like there's quite a number of painpoints from learning and doing coding that I might be able to create micro-tools to address. 

  

*   **Meh, but not so monetizable -**  
    Revamp **Public Design Jobs** and some of my #1mvp1month products, just for mixing in some randomness. For social good, and random fun.

  

I'd already started on Your Life In Months, so fingers crossed. As per my [Singular September](https://200wordsaday.com/words/singular-september-263275d6d1e4da5cd5) goals, I hope to launch it before the end of September, and get just ONE paying customer!
