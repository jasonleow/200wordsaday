I send messages to myself in my Telegram app, for all sorts of things: useful links I want to get back to, text that I want to copy from my phone to my laptop, and sometimes, awesome quotes and ideas I read from somewhere and want to archive. I was scrolling through it as part of recollecting and reflecting on my year in 2019, and saw this short line that I wrote 2 years ago, in July 2017:

  

> _I'm so tired of food. Food as gratification; as coping & comfort; as avoidance. I'm exhausted from always swinging between bloatedness and craving, all the while feeling my health spiral downwards._

  

Wow. How things have turned over the past 2 years. 

  

If I were to make a list of things regarding food that I could never foresee myself doing 2 years ago but do so now, it would be:

  

*   Quit savoury, fatty fried foods like potato chips, fries, fast food. 
*   Quit milk and diary like ice cream.
*   Quit my sweet carbs like pastries and desserts.
*   Quit white rice and many of the home-cooked dishes I came to love.
*   Quit having so much green veg and fibre-rich foods. 
*   Eat mainly fats and meat.
*   Getting back to a weight that I last had in my **mid-twenties** (about 15 years ago)
*   Feeling lean, healthy and well again.

  

It's been a crazy journey the past few years, health-wise. Many things happened _**to**_ me, but it also happened _**for**_ me, for my growth, my learning. And gaining greater clarity about my relationship with food, understanding how nutrition works, and listening to the body had been those things that happened _for_ me.

  

Another message that popped up as I scrolled down my saved messages:

You couldn't have summed it up better, Mr Hippocrates.
