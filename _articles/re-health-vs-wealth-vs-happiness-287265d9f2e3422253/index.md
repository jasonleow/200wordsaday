@keni asked a most interesting [question]( https://200wordsaday.com/words/health-vs-wealth-vs-happiness-286805d9e2a8ec2387): between health, wealth and happiness, which would you choose?

  

Most would choose happiness. (And at her event, most did.) But she chose health. Likewise for me.

  

I believe health is actually the source for the other two. Without health, you can't be truly happy (too sick to be) and it'll be hard to create wealth (no energy to work towards it). So not all of life's pursuits are created equal. Some set the stage, till the soil, and create the base conditions for other aspects to thrive.

  

Health is also the easiest to take for granted, especially in our younger years. I remember the days in my 20s when I could stay up late, eat junk, smoke, drink and just shrug off the hangover or no sleep like dust off the shoulder. Nobody really cares about health when everything is rosy and working. Only later now in my 40s did I realise how mistaken I had been, and wished I had learned about health back then in wholesome ways that would stick despite youth ignorance.

  

Health is so under-valued, but over-delivered.

If anything, turning 40 this year only made me more aware of the other things in my life that are under-valued but over-delivered. Parents, a stable country, the internet...what else? ?
