I think since I recognise and accept that I am in a writing slump, I am not going to fight it and just go with it. But how does one keep writing everyday despite a slump? By **cheating**. 

  

Consider this the second post of a series of posts to cheat your slump and keep your streak. The first cheat post was yesterday, about writing about not knowing what to write. How the cheat works is that instead of writing about the chosen topic of the day - whatever that topic might be - you go meta and comment (positively or negatively) about the act of writing the topic (or not writing it). 

  

Confused? Good. That is the whole point hahaha!

  

@lucjah [commented](https://200wordsaday.com/words/don-t-know-what-to-write-write-about-not-knowing-what-to-write-86725c62be2a2a899) that this is content versus process. Content being the "what", the topic, and process refers to the "why" or "how". A great analysis that brings method to the madness, because now I can use it as a cheat! Whereas before, I was just improvising on the spot because I did not know what to write! There was no method. Just madness. 

  

So.... Don't know what to write? Writer's block? Write about not knowing what to write. Or look through the main 200wad feed, choose a random topic, and comment on not knowing what to write about the topic. Share your pain and frustration with the world. Rinse and repeat. 

  

And there. I just cheated again today. 242 words hahaha!
