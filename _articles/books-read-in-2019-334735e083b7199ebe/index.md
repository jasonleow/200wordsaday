2019 had been a year of revival for me when it comes to reading. More accurately, most of the books were read in later half of the year, when I started on my indie maker journey, and needed fresh inspiration and ideas to nudge me forward. 

  

It started when I took a month off the grid in July–no appointments, networking events, coffees or lunches. Just reading and thinking and planning. That month really broke the dry season that had been going on for years, and got me started back on regular reading. Since then, I dedicated the first hour or so of my workday to learning by reading. It's amazing how fast you can blaze through your reading list when you do a bit of it every day, every week. 

  

I got through **29 books in 6 months**, so that averages about at least 4 books per month, or **1 book per week**. WOW. ? Again and again, this typifies my reading habits and patterns. It's either bone-dry season, with zero inspiration no books read or books attempted but dropped after a while. Or it's pours, biblical flood style. I think the dry seasons are usually also the seasons when work is busy and not too exciting or inspiring, stress and exhaustion is high, and overall energy levels are low. When it rains books, it usually happens at life or career transitions when I am searching for new inspiration and direction, and thus new knowledge and ideas. That's why most books are focused around motivation, money, career and productivity. I could definitely read more fiction and alternative history, just for the fun of it.

  

But nevertheless, I'm keen to keep this habit of reading for an hour every workday from here onwards, transition or not. It's my job to stay inspired. I also enjoy learning. I usually start my goals being "I want to see if I can learn my way to..." So what better way to read my way to all that I want to achieve?

**Motivational, career success and productivity**

1.  ?Antifragile: Things that gain from disorder - Nassim Taleb  
    \- most profound book I read this year that shifted my deeper paradigms in ways I'm not even fully aware yet
2.  ?Atomic Habits: Tiny changes, remarkable results. An easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones - James Clear  
    \- learned that habit formation is a skill that I can learn and get better at. In fact, learning how to form good habits and break bad ones should be required education in schools.
3.  ?How To Get Rich - Naval Ravikant  
    \- not strictly a book. It was a tweetstorm that went viral, that became a podcast, got transcribed, got more podcasts built around it. I think it qualifies as a book now. Changed my view of wealth, that ethical wealth creation is possible.
4.  Rework - Jason Fried, DHH
5.  ?It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work - Jason Fried, DHH  
    \- all the books I read from Basecamp were great myth-busters of "hustle porn". Made me more aware of the startup myths I unknowingly bought into, and should drop. Life-changing in the work-life balance conversation.
