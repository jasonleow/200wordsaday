From "[Play October](https://200wordsaday.com/words/play-october-wrap-up-sparking-joy-in-work-301995dbbff3614d37)", I got pretty excited trying out new JAMstack tools recently, and that really ignited a learning fervour to want to dive in more into JAMstack, and building out more random sites from it - perhaps some for learning (like making a new [blog](https://jasonleowsg-a9c20.netlify.com/?widget) and importing content from my [old Wordpress blog](https://jasonleow.sg)), some for money (using JAMstack to create niche sites for other niche businesses). So, GatsbyJS, Netlify, Stackbit - I'm coming for you! More Javascript and APIs this month! So, **more code with JAMstack!**

  

Making a nocode product [Keto List Singapore](https://table2site.com/site/ketolistsingapore) from concept to launch all within 3 days in October, and getting that elusive **1 customer** (a target which I missed in September) all within 1 week, had been a great top-up on my motivation tank. It made me remember how easy and fun it is to create products using nocode. But more importantly, it provided a _stark reminder_ that even while I'm serious about learning to code in Rails, Javascript etc, I don't need to turn my back on nocode tools, just because. Moreover, [@bentossell](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1190307912255770624) and the folks at [Makerpad](https://nocodevember.com/) started a Twitter challenge [#nocodevember](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nocodevember?src=hash) for the month of November, to encourage people to "improve your building skills, develop good habits and open up to the power of no-code." There's even prizes/swag up for grabs too, so that sounds fun. I have at least one productized service product that I had already done the research and kept in the drawer, so I might just use that to create a nocode product. So, **more 'code' with nocode!** 

  

Of course, I'm not forgetting about Ruby on Rails. I still have a web app [Your Life In Months](http://www.yourlifeinmonths.com/) waiting in the sidelines. I do want to finish that up. I admit that I pushed myself too hard on Rails in September, to the point I felt kind of burnt out on it in October. But after the creative detours in JAMstack and nocode, I feel more energised than ever to get back into the basics of coding, and to understand Ruby _and_ Rails. I want to build out the remaining 1-2 features that I had done part-way through, and to wrap it up with learning either Tailwind or Bulma for CSS. So, **more code with Rails!**

  

Can you see the theme? So for November, it's going to be **More Code November**:

  

*   More JAMstack
*   More nocode
*   More Rails

  

I'm sure this sounds like I'm biting off more than I can chew, but hey, I'm going to just follow my energy and excitement, and see how far I land. Maybe it's not exactly attainable and realistic, but I've come to the realisation that I should never really care for that when it comes to dreaming big.

  

So yes, more more more for November it is!
