I was quite enamoured by the childhood vision that @basilesamel painted. He wanted to work in a space like a mad scientist's lab, full of gear and equipment. A lab of someone eccentric yet wise. 

  

What a lovely vision! Coincidentally and interestingly, it was very relatable for me too. I loved Emmet Brown's lab in _Back To The Future,_ and of course, Tony's Starks's lab when he was making his Iron Man suits - that was in fact, my favourite scenes in the movie than the fighting ones. I recalled coming home from a comedy movie Young Einstein back when I was still little, and inspired by that Einstein who tinkered with machines to split atoms to make bubbles in beer (what?), I proceeded to dismantle my toy cars! It was fun. 

  

Tinkerers, inventors, mad scientists types always fascinated me. Making things in their space drew me in.

  

What would my ideal tinkering work space look like?

  

A large warehouse space, with huge industrial windows spanning from almost floor to ceiling. Lush greenery outside, and not a whisper of traffic or crowds coming in. Only the occasional bird chirping, or the rustling of leaves in the wind. In the background, light ambient electronic music plays. The walls are all painted white, and in that huge space, a couple of huge work tables spaced out spaciously, at the height of bar tables, so that they facilitated working while standing up. I like working on my feet. The tables have wheels, so that I can freely re-arrange them as needed. And located on the tables are making equipment - Mac computers, massive industrial printers, 3D printers, CNC cutters, Arduino circuit boards, carpentry tools, silk screens for printing, manual letterpress printers, cutting boards, loads of markers, papers, pencils... Everything one needs to make anything digital or analogue. Peppered throughout the tables are scores of prototypes that I made, half-working products, works-in-progress. At a glance, I can see all my work, my progress, and where I aspire to head towards. But it does not feel cluttered. Mess and clutter is a creeping disease for the mind, it messes with my clarity, and creates a brain fog that makes it hard to work well. A minimalistic, tidy space, yet full of the things I love and need. And let's not forget - at the corner of this warehouse lab, a full cooking pantry, with coffee machines, water and fridges full of food to make other sort of things - the kinds I can eat. Everyday, I come in, make my coffee, and see what I can work with my hands for the morning. Always start with the hands, move around with the feet. Then later, I move on to working on my computer for the rest of the day, coding, designing, marketing, writing. All the while, undisturbed in this white space, that is a metaphorical embodiment of my craft as well as my mindspace. 

  

Heaven.
