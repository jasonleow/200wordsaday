In trying to understand [wandergrief](https://200wad.com/words/wandergrief-the-aftermath-of-wanderlust-151075cb72d6a938c5) from my past experiences, I'm already slowly but surely leaving behind my present one. It feels right. So I will keep going. This was not the first time I'd been down this road.

  

What lessons from the past can I take comfort in? What hangover cures might there be?

  

This time, it is from Helsinki, Finland in August 2014. Helsinki was the last stop on a 6-week solo sabbatical trip, after leaving a particularly exhausting job. I started in Bordeaux, France where I spent 3 weeks in Plum Village, meditating, practising mindfulness and mindful living. A much needed retreat. After that, I made my way through land, air and water (really! I took overnighters on trains, planes and cruise ships) to Denmark, Sweden, then Finland. It was a mind-blowing trip for sure. Mindfulness and Scandinavia works well together, me thinks. Something about the culture, the nature, quality of life, pace of the cities, the people, made Scandinavia a good post-retreat travel.

Helsinki, Finland in August 2014. It's the last stop on an amazing trip. I swam in the Vantaa river and the Kuusijärvi lake, visited Temppeliaukio Church, a church carved into rock monolith, strolled in the native birchwood forests around Pikkukosken Uimaranta. Wood and water, rock and metal. Just rough, raw nature in all it's natural, unpolished beauty, blended into spaces and things with such a unique Arctic sensibility. It was so deeply enchanting.

  

I love how Finland's northern landscape inspires the work of Finnish artists and designers, and how they took that as their own and created a very unique, native design vernacular around their nature. I hear of their longing for the forests, for their native culture, for their traditions centred around the water, trees and rock, and I'm too filled with a longing to find the equivalent of that artistic/design vernacular in Singapore.

  

Just hear these words - it gives me goosebumps:

  

_Hemskogen,_

_livslinjernas hemvist._

The nearby woods,

the home of life lines.
