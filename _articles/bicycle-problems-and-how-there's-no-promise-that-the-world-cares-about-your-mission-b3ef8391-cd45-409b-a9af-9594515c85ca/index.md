@brandonwilson wrote about this chapter in Seth Godin's book _The Practice: Shipping Creative Work._ Reproducing in whole below because it's just too good and on point for my work, and the whole indie makers movement:

His starting few lines could have very well been written for me. _How long have you practised? It might take longer than that. It might take months._ That's alarmingly accurate of my [#decodingcoding](#decodingcoding) journey. I'm feeling impatient recently about my progress. But like he said, patience. 

The rest of it was also so on point because you can probably see that discussion play out on every forum or Twitter thread about indie makers and bootstrap startups. Go ultra niche, they say. Offer some unique that your competitors don't, they advised. Change the world, follow your passion, stick to your mission, they shout. 

BUT there's no promise that anyone would care about your mission. Seriously.

There's no single silver bullet, but a confluence of factors that will bring success. Product-founder fit isn't enough. You got to have product-market fit too. Passion and mission are great things to have which I wouldn't recommend otherwise, but just that alone isn't enough. It's idealistic at best, naive at worst. The reality of the market has a very humbling way of grounding anyone with those just those tendencies. I love how the author elaborated on this concept via the unicycle story. Makes it all the more salient, and comical.

Patience, but no promises.
