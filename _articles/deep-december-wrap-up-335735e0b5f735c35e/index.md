My goal for [December](https://200wordsaday.com/words/deep-december-320325de3c95c78560) was to go deep, into my metaphorical cave to reflect on how 2019 had been for me: 

  

> _Retreat. Reflect. Rest. Rekindle._

  

Done this month:

  

*   Hit [one year streak](https://200wordsaday.com/words/a-year-of-daily-writing-323555dea5fa132b14) of writing daily on 200wad

*   Collating all my [insights](https://200wordsaday.com/words/counter-intuitive-things-i-learned-about-nutrition-while-on-intermittent-fasting-and-keto-330455dfa2bb3718e0) and learning points from doing keto and intermittent fasting

Overall, I think I'd done Deep December well. It's an easy month, to be honest. Reflection comes easy for me. I enjoy it too much, in fact.

It's been nice to have the luxury and time to reflect on the past. I find it's hard to see where you want to head towards next, if you didn't have a good understanding of where you had been previously. Without hindsight, I repeat old mistakes cyclically. Bad habits go unnoticed. Unhealthy attitudes go uncorrected. Not repeating past errors in the future is just as important as acting on the new goals in the future.

  

_The first time is a mistake. The second time is a choice._

  

Seeing the past without regrets, not as a burden but as a source of learning and gratitude, had always provided me with the fuel to power ahead into a future I can feel optimistic about.

  

But even so, after a whole month of so much reflection, I feel I had done quite enough for a while. I'm ready and raring to go. Already I feel the pull of the new year, the new decade, and the opportunities it might bring. I want to jump right into action...NOW!

  

Onwards.

  

And Happy New Year! ?
