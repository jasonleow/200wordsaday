Back in December last year, I wrote this [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/conditions-for-joy-and-happiness-4405c0c9f8fcd138) about asking what might be the conditions for cultivating joy and happiness, for me. My latest version (v1.2) then, looked like this:

  

### ?Happiness formula (v1.2):

?+self care

??+physical activity

?+hobby fun

?+create creatively

?+enjoying music

?+enjoying the world

?+time with people you love

??+being challenged, out of comfort zones

?+heartbreaking experiences

?+enough money, food, shelter

  

A lot can happen in one year. And a lot did. The [2019 past year review of positives and negatives](https://200wordsaday.com/words/2019-past-year-review-of-positives-negatives-333165e021045b3a57) that I did yesterday did show up some new factors for joy and happiness. Some from last year also felt somewhat shallow, and might have deepened this year. So, new iteration of my happiness formula:

  

### ?Happiness formula (v2.0):

? Sense of wellbeing and good health/strength, in body, mind, sleep, diet.

? Health and happiness of my family, and spending dedicated time with them.

? Sense of growth and progress. Learning something new regularly and being inspired by fresh ideas, knowledge, places, people. And creatively creating often - products, words, images, actions.

? Control and autonomy to do my own thing every day, solo, at my own pace and time, following my energy and curiosity instead of the deadlines and 'shoulds' of others/society.

?‍♂️ Simply saying NO more often, to toxic people, environments, projects, events, work, conversations, media. And/or advocating for my own preferences and needs. 

? Earning more than enough money, hitting my financial goals.

?? Being challenged outside of comfort zones in things I want to.

  

Perhaps the best way to use this list is to refer to it anytime you feel down or unhappy. It's usually a sign that something on the list is missing in your life. 

  

A friend also added that, while it's good to know the external conditions to nurture your own happiness, it's also important to be mindful, to not get too attached to being able to control and manipulate the external world to suit my conditions for happiness. 

  

To _**not**_ say "I will only be happy when there's this condition."

To say instead, "I can choose to water the seeds of joy and happiness at any moment, even if something happens outside of my wishes. That power is within me."

  

_So, what's your happiness formula?_
