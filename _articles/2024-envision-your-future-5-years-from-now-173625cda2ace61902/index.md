This post was inspired by a [thread](https://200wordsaday.com/words/5-years-from-now-166795cd059ceb8415) that @santhoshguru started from weeks back. It was about imagining what how your writing will look like after writing everyday for 5 years. I enjoyed the thread, but felt that I wanted to use this writing device to explore this theme about the future in a broader sense, regarding life in general. 

  

Five years from today. 2024. I'll be 45. A day in the life of me, imagined. Where would I be? Who would I be with? Would I be a father by then? What am I doing for work? How does it feel to be doing all that? Am I excited about life? How have I grown? How have my wife and I grown together? 

  

Specifically, I wanted to write imaginary posts of a day in the life in 5 years' time, as if I was writing in the present. And to write it in the way that I had enjoyed recently - in a blow-by-blow, [sensorially-descriptive](https://200wordsaday.com/words/is-writing-the-new-instagram-146595cb08b518d59a) way like this post I wrote about a [perfect morning](https://200wordsaday.com/words/kintsugi-mornings-138675ca348de9407c) doing a craft I loved. Instead of writing it in a factual, matter-of-fact way, like when at a job interview where someone asks you "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" Cringe-worthy. No, I'm not writing that kind of posts. 

  

It will be an exercise in imagination. Daydreams about the future. Future-storming. And I can't wait!
