The average life expectancy of a Singaporean is 82-ish. I turned 41 yesterday. So this makes it my expected half way mark in life.

  

50% progress. Another 50% to go.

  

It's mid life, but the strange thing is, I don't feel like I'm past my peak heading down a general decline. With first time fatherhood, a newborn under my wings, it feels like a new season of life altogether. Fresh. Novel. Motivating. Career-wise had been challenging, but likewise, I also sense an inevitable transition from a design career path of the last 10 years to being an independent maker, creator. The act of creating products is—as always—life-giving, so that too feels like a new season of life. Health-wise, with keto and other biohacking practices, I can feel my health returning, and my weight going back a decade when I was 30s.

  

So rather than expecting a mid-life crisis as we stereotypically do, how about gunning for a mid-life _breakthrough_ instead?

  

Charging down the door for breakthroughs at 41 sounds hard and inappropriate. People become billionaires in their 20s, and peak in their 30s! But I'd always been a late bloomer.

  

I'd rather be fashionably late than ripened too early. ?
