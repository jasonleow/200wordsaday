There's a local personal finance comic series called [The Woke Salaryman](https://www.facebook.com/wokesalaryman/photos/a.2259315404383967/2647775082204662/?type=3) that I enjoy reading. The artist recently drew a story about his father getting retrenched in the last economic recession as a way to talk about the pending recession from COVID, and one of his lines resonated deeply.

  

> _Only in recession will you know if you can truly afford something. In good times, it's easy to buy cars, condos and have expensive holidays. Recession gives us a reality check on our lifestyles, and tells us exactly what we need to cut. If it hurts to pay, then it's got to go. ~ The Woke Salaryman_

  

I'm not the spendthrift sort, don't own a car or a condo, but even so, during lockdown there's been quite a bit of money anxiety. Seeing my savings slowly dry up added to that. It was a harsh reality check on my lifestyle, but in truth it was sweet pain. I realised I could stay at home a lot more than I thought myself could bear. Pre-COVID, I couldn't even bear to stay home for one day. And with staying home, my expenses dropped dramatically. No need for commuting and paying for public transport. No need for expensive lunches, or multiple connoisseur coffees while working at nice cafes. No random purchase from the shops and supermarkets I walk past when out.Â 

  

My living expenses took a two to three-fold reduction from not having to pay for all that. Which was a relief, but also a good lesson, not just about what I can truly afford, but also how little I truly need to be _**enough**_.

  

Just enough, to be contented.
