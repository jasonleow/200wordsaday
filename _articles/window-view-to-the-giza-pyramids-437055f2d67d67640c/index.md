I just spent ten minutes watching the (video) view of someone else's window on [Window Swap](https://window-swap.com/window). This window belongs to Abdulrahman, who live in Giza, Egypt, and his window is front seat view to the Great Pyramids. What a view! 

  

I sat there, mesmerized, transfixed, at these ancient monuments, like as if I was there myself. The video was of course not in real-time, but for a brief moment, it felt like my own window, and I was there in Egypt. On the horizon, the pyramids sat, as they had for millennia. But in the foreground, faint but ever-present horns from the traffic below. It wasn't annoying... in fact, it gave a sense of life to the otherwise still scene. Occasionally, a police siren goes off, or the louder horn of a large truck breaks the monotone. I felt like I was part of the life that's flowing below, yet safely distant from it all, enveloped by a lazy midday calm. The clear, bluish grey sky out from quaint white louvre window; a soft glow of the afternoon sun; the jazzy symphony of the car horns below, and silent sentinels of the pyramids witnessing it all. A mood, like having just woken up after a siesta, still feeling the delicious half-sleep, but grateful for the life leaking in through the window. And eagerly looking forward to the evening dinner to come. 

  

A nice imagination trip, for sure. And strangely calming.

  

_Super grateful to @andrewtsao for this recommending this cool resource._
