One day, it will happen. Not today. Likely not tomorrow. But one day in the future, for sure. An over-nighter on a plane. An epic day where you just collapsed into bed out of exhaustion. Or just watching too much TV and plain forgetting. One day, I will lose my streak.  

  

I just read @brianball 's [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/3-21-187785cee5dfcdf3e9) about losing his streak, and this line made me sit up:

  

> In fact, I've argued that the whole streak think is a dubious incentive at best and possibly carries to much negative weight for the inevitable day you've simply got too much life to life.

  

It's so true... yet how do we continue to partake in the streak mechanism unaffected? I love the streak mechanism for nudging me to keep certain habits. Though I'm naturally an upholder and usually have no problems keeping a plan or routine, I do enjoy the extra slight push that the streak gives, because writing everyday is hard and that push does make a difference.

  

But you know, to be **completely, bystander-neutral kind of objective**, the streak _is_ a game we invented ourselves, to play with ourselves. It's a game where we are the banker, player and opponent rolled into one. We are the banker, creating the streak game and the rules and incentives of it. We are the player, playing it everyday, keeping to the rules, and enjoying the winnings (or losses!) based on our play performance. We are also the opponent, because forgetfulness, laziness, lack of discipline, ideas, time all compete with the player in us.Â 

  

Strange overlaps of interests and conflicts for sure! :D
