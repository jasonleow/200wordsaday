Great question offered in James Clear's recent newsletter, as always. Just in line with my musings about [radical simplicity and washing my bowl](https://cowriters.app/words/wash-your-bowl-411655ed7a9e9b950a), and finding a way to [restart in June](https://cowriters.app/words/jason-s-june-411215ed65d9854b04). 

  

I tried to make a list of the biggest small things I could do today, now. And this is what I came up with:

  

*   Clear my desk some more.
*   Clean my study room.
*   Clean the toilet.
*   Sleep early.
*   Go cut my hair.
*   Start meditating in the mornings again.
*   Start running again, 3x per week.
*   Read 1h before starting work everyday, as I used to before.
*   Start listening to podcasts again for inspiration.

  

I noticed, these are not work-related at all, even though in restarting I really meant it for work. 

  

How strange. 

  

That the biggest small things I could do to restart are the most mundane daily things. Mundane things that are completely unrelated to my goals, at best tangential. Things that take care of myself first, my well-being, my mental space. 

  

Counterintuitive, but makes complete sense. That the basic conditions to grow towards the sun, are the most ordinary—even dirty things—like soil, water, air. My soil, water and air are the physical space in which I work, the bag of flesh and bone that I embody, and the infinite realms in the mind. 

  

Just the simple things first. Baby steps. Bearing fruits, and harvesting—my goals, that is—comes way later.
