Since opening up [Keto List Singapore](https://ketolistsingapore.com) to ads, I'd been having coffee with ad buyers—keto bakers and sellers—just to chat and understand their business and business needs. So far, there's been more than a handful interested in advertising, and already four had paid for ads, some for a whole six-months block. I'm flabbergasted. That was not the response I was expecting for a site that's just been around for four months, with 1000+ page views per month. As much as I'm still not believing this is real, it seems like something stuck...and everyday I'm just holding my breath out for when this lucky streak will end. 

  

A question that had constantly popped up at these coffee meetups was: "_**What are your plans for Keto List?**_" And every single time, I'm dumbfounded for a few micro-seconds – too long in a conversation if you ask me. Sure, I have a product roadmap, features that I'd like to build, but that's not what they are really asking (even though that's how I usually answer). Truth is, I don't have long term vision for Keto List, which is weird for someone who is all too fond of having long term visions and plans every step of the way. I think it's because I created this product on a whim, using nocode tools. It was simply to be a tool for helping me on my keto diet. I didn't have big ambitions starting out, and didn't expect to have them later on either. 

  

That initially made me uncomfortable. _I'd always been the man with a plan! This was unbecoming!_

  

But after deeper reflection, I thought perhaps this is a nice limbo to be in, uncomfortable and weird it may feel. I'd been wrestling with the themes of surrender versus ambition, and this situation seems to be providing quite a curious study for just that. 

  

_**How do I keep growing and improving something, but surrendering any expectation, and not ascribing any of my current and future happiness to it?**_  

  

I don't know the answer to that question, but I think I will find out through this journey working on Keto List.

  

Besides, **your foresight is only as far ahead as how far back your hindsight is**, as mentioned by [@marckohlbrugge](https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1232994861634199553?s=21):

  

> _I think a good rule of thumb is to count the days since you started working on your product and look the same amount of days ahead. Started yesterday? Just think about tomorrow. Not any further. Started a month ago? Plan about 30 days in advance.

> Having a long-term vision from day one might do you more harm than good. It closes you off from new opportunities and insights. You're letting guesses dictate your fate rather than lived experiences and information. Don't think ahead too far. Take it one step at a time._ 

  

Four months in since I started Keto List, but I don't even feel like I can look four months ahead. But if does show me what I need to prioritise and build out for the next month or two. So the heuristic still kind of holds, perhaps more useful for indie makers. It's not meant to be a science, anyway. 

  

And that's such a huge relief. 

  

_No plans? No problem._ 

  

_It'll come. In time._ 

  

_Meantime, ambition away yet surrender still._
