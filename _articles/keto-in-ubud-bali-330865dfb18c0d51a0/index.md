So I'd been travelling a bit in Ubud, Bali. Spent 10 days here. I was initially a little apprehensive about finding keto-compliant foods, as I'm not all too familiar with Indonesian cooking. And Ubud is known for lots of healthy, vegan restaurants, so I wasn’t sure if there’s any keto there.

  

But along the way, I discovered many places that have delicious food that’s really wholesome, locally-grown fresh and can be keto-friendly (with some customization of course).

**EATERIES**

  

?Bali Buda - one of my top fav for healthy wholesome food. Order paleo platter, bulletproof coffee, salad, zoodles. Grocery store has brazil nuts, pecans, coconut yoghurt, cacao butter.

  

?Casa Luna - great service. Order mega brekkie with extra avocados, eggs, bacon

  

?Naught Nuri's - a small roadside diner famous for bbq ribs. Just order without bbq sauce.

  

?Halal Ubud Burger - one of the few halal eateries around. Order beef burger without onions, add extra egg or patty

  

?Ubud Gluten Free Kitchen - first few restaurants catching on to keto. Order breakfast mains, keto muffin, bulletproof coffee

  

☕️Seniman Coffee - best single origin coffees in Ubud. Order soto ayam without noodles, or salad.

  

?? Warung Pulau Kelapa - great traditional Indonesian fare. Order soto ayam without noodles, bebek goreng, tauhu telur, gado gado without sauce

  

?Atman Kafe - very Eat Pray Love here. Order eggs, salad with extra avocado, bulletproof coffee, cold brew.

  

?Locavore To Go - a burger joint run by a butchery. Great burgers and steaks/meats

  

?The Elephant - breathtaking view here. Order triple omelette with no fries, more lettuce

  

?Clear Cafe - the place to be and be seen. Order omelettes with extras like avocado, salads

  

?Bebek Bengil - a little touristy as it's on the main shopping street of Money Forest Road, but the deep fried duck is a local delicacy and a must-try.

  

?Ibu Oka - similar to Bebek Bengil, babi guling (suckling pig) and its roasted pork skin is a famous Balinese dish, and Ibu Oka is a local favourite. Nice as a snack, as there's little else to eat.

  

**SUPERMARKETS**

  

⭐️Bintang supermarket - a local supermarket with lots of souvenirs snacks. Get the spicy pork rinds made from free range, vegetable-fed, hormone-/antibiotic-free pork

  

?Pepito supermarket - a Western supermarket for expats. Biokul greek yoghurt(3g carb per serving), frozen raspberries, unsweetened soymilk (brand: Australia’s Own Organic)

  

⚠️Delta Dewata (Jln Raya Andong) - local’s supermarket but surprisingly there’s Konnyaku slabs, shirataki noodles, Biokul greek yoghurt.

Now I'm wondering, if a 'travel' section on [Keto List Singapore](https://ketolistsingapore.com) will be helpful for us keto folks when we travel ? Imagine having a list of keto-friendly places in popular cities around the region, recommended by fellow keto folks!
