Where is your secret place?   

  

A place where you can be quiet and whole, without feeling that you need to be somewhere else? Where is this place where you can have peace without fear of being disturbed by anyone? Where is this place that inspires, refreshes and nourishes you? 

  

Is it a secluded beach only accessible by boat? Or a tiny cave in the mountains that you stumbled upon when you got lost once? Could it be a patch of forest far in from a highway that no one walks through? Maybe a spot in a corn field that no one knows about? For city dwellers, could it be perhaps just an abandoned playground in a quiet neighbourhood? 

  

I read about this practice of a secret place that Native American Indians have. They each have a secret place to connect to the Divine, a place where only they know and no one else does or goes there. And they don't tell one another about it. It's a secret, after all. What a great idea! And much needed especially in such crazy times.

  

I'm now searching for my secret place. I think I found some in countries away from home, in Bali, in Japan, in Iceland. But not yet in Singapore. Tough situation, because Singapore is smaller than more major cities of the world, and we have almost zero countryside. It's a city state, after all.

  

Where's my secret place? In this concrete jungle, where might it be?
