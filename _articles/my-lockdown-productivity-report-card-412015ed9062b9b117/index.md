A friend suggested that I take some time to appreciate myself for what I had already done since the two-month lockdown. It's time to cut myself some slack and embody this self appreciation today, before moving on to the future. It probably seems like a humblebrag—"my lockdown productivity report card"—but I don't care much at this point. If I have to humblebrag a bit to perk myself up a little, I'll take it.  

  

So I made 7 products over about 2 months. Here's all of them:  

  

? [Tools for COVID-19](https://sheet2site.com/s/toolsforcovid19/) - a resource listings site for small-medium businesses affected by COVID. 629 users, 1.3k page views 32 listings, 1 newspaper feature. 

? [Dabao Dash](https://sheet2site.com/s/dabaodash/) - a self-help community board matching hawkers and F&Bs with delivery drivers. 8.9k users, 16.9k page views, 220 listings, 2 news features.

?‍♂️ [Majulah Belanja](https://sheet2site.com/s/majulahbelanja/) - an offers and requests board for matching donations-in-kind to migrant workers and their employers/dorm operators. 4.3k users, 11.1k page views, 537 listings, a few news features. 

?‍? [VisualAid](https://visualaid.sg) - visual aids of illustrated translations to help healthcare professionals communicate better with migrant workers. 3k users, 5.3k page views, 6 visual aid collections, 3 news features.

? [COVID-19 SG Survey](https://covidsgsurvey.netlify.app) -  a research and survey site by a sustainability NGO working on COVID data.  

☔️ [It’s Raining Raincoats-C19-Migrant Workers Help](https://irr-c19-mwhelp.netlify.app) - a information resource site for a migrant worker voluntary group.

? [COVID Hiring](https://sheet2site.com/api/v3/index.php?key=1T-qbP2pDZEu-cYQzbbdGapzOqRsE31oF0AgGJIu09Ro) - a 'reverse' job board to help professionals who got lost their jobs due to COVID. The 'client' didn't follow up with launching it, but I still count this as a product completed and handed over.

  

**Work in progress:**

? [We Tell Stories Community](https://wtscommunitysg.netlify.app/) - a video content maker focused on positive stories and messaging during COVID.

? [Market List SG](https://marketlistsg.carrd.co/#two) - a listing site of online grocers to help Singaporeans diversify their grocery sources and skip queues, even the online queues.

? 4 requests for free creative portfolio sites (to help creatives affected by COVID), of which 1 is work-in-progress.

  

I think for these two months, I did enough for the rest of the year! Or even next year. 

  

Do I get my break now?
